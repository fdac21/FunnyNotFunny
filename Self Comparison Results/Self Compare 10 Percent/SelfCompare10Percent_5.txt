 You know, you know what I was thinking about all day today? This is really weird.
 First of all, I’m nervous.
 I should tell you that.
 You can’t tell, but, all inside.
 I was thinking about a person I never actually met, but I heard about all my life.
 I was thinking about my great grandfather, who apparently, by all accounts, was a very great man.
 He was born a slave in South Carolina.
 Was a slave for ten years of his life.
 And when the northerners came down, they started educating some of the newly freed black children, and he learned how to read.
 Got enamored with education and dedicated his life to three things: Education, freedom of black people, Jesus Christ.
 Became a juggernaut in the AME Church.
 It was a pretty amazing story my great grandfather had, and I thought about him all day today because I wish I could see him now.
 And I wish he could see me, because I wonder what he would say.
 This week I flew to New York on a private jet to host the Saturday Night Live.
 Netflix started streaming a show that bears his name, The Chappelle Show.
 And HBO Max is streaming it.
----Punchline----
 And I didn’t get paid for any of it.
----Tagline(s)----
 Yeah, if he could see me now he’d probably be like, “this nigga got bought and sold more than I have.”

 So what I did is I did shows in my neighbor’s cornfield, and these shows were very successful and may have even helped save the town.

 “What about a very powerful light? Directly in the body?”
 I say, what? Did this man just suggest that I put sunshine directly in my body? Well, that’s insane! He went further.
 “What about some bleach? Some bleach directly in your body.”
 I said, oh, boy.
 Secret service is gonna have to childproof the White House now, he’s gonna try to drink the bleach! “Mr.President, don’t touch that stove, it’s hot.

It is going to get way worse than that.
 Then I thought of an idea for a children’s book.
 I actually wrote it.
 It is coming out soon.
 The book is designed to help parents, teach their children about racism which, if you’re a parent you know is an impossible concept to teach to a child.
 But I’m doing it.
 The book is about a big, strong beautiful Black man with a benign, regular-ass White name… and he has a White speaking voice.
----Punchline----
 So whenever this motherfucker calls to get a reservation at a restaurant, oh, he gets the reservation.

 North Carolina passed a law once.

 No, no, no, no.
 No, that is not a good law.
 That is a mean law.

   Juneteenth is a strange holiday, isn’t it?[audience]
 Yes.
It commemorates when Black people in Texarkana area of the country first found out that they were free.
 But remember, they were free when they found out.
 They just didn’t know it yet.
 Very interesting holiday.
 You know, I learned something This is a wild story.
 I learned this past Juneteenth of a story, this is true.
 And it’s that there was a Black man who was in South Carolina during slavery who somehow got granted his freedom by his so-called master.
 And when his master granted him the freedom he also gave him a plot of land.
 Now it turns out, this brother was brilliant.
 He had a good eye, good knack for farming.
 And he farmed this plot of land very successfully and made a lot of money, and this is where the story gets crazy.
----Punchline----
 When he got all that money… this nigga brought some slaves.

 How the fuck are you going to survive in show business if this is an actual obstacle to your dreams? I know Louis is wrong, man.
 I’m just saying, I’m held to a higher standard of accountability than these women are.


Don’t forget who I am.
 Don’t forget what I am.
 I am a black dude.
 And don’t ever forget how I got here.
 My ancestors were kidnapped.
 I don’t even know where the fuck I’m from.
 They were put on the bottom of boats.
 They sailed them across the Atlantic.
 Many of them died.
 Only the strongest survived.
 And once they got here, they beat the humanity out of my people.
 They turned us into beasts of burdens.
 They made us do their work, and the irony is, hundreds of years later they’re calling us lazy.
 We fought in the Civil War.
 We damn near freed ourselves.
 Then, with Reconstruction, black people did great.
 My great-grandfather was a very wealthy man.
 But then the Black Codes came, Jim Crow came, and it was a hundred years of unspeakable oppression again.
 Lynchings, all kinds of terroristic acts to keep us in the margins of society.
 Yet, we still fought.
 And Dr. King was born.
 And then, things got better.
 Twenty years after Dr. King was assassinated, Michael Jackson was moonwalking on television.
 Something, something, something.

 Man, I know nothing about being a woman, but I know fear.
 Yo, I used to live in New York when I was 17.
 I couldn’t even pay my bills.
 You know what I did to make money? I used to do shows for drug dealers that wanted to clean their money up.
 One time I did a real good set, and these motherfuckers called me in the back room.
 They gave me $25,000 in cash.
 I was probably 18, 19 years old.
 I was scared.
 I thanked them profusely, I put that money in my backpack, I jumped on the subway and started heading towards Brooklyn at one in the morning.
 Never been that terrified in my life.
 Because I’d never in my life had something that somebody else would want.
 I thought to myself, “Jesus Christ, if these motherfuckers knew how much money I had in this backpack, they’d kill me for it.”
 Then I thought, “Holy shit.
