During the process of executing this warrant, this white woman did what Chris Dorner thought was excessive force.
 I don’t know what she did.
 She kicked the mother fucker that was handcuffed, or hit a guy that was handcuffed, or something.
 Chris Dorner, the Black police officer that watched this white woman do this, reported this to his superior.
 Made a formal complaint.
 And was subsequently fired from the LA PD.
He went through the system.
He took every legal avenue he believed he had to get reinstated.
And he was not reinstated.
And when his last appeal was finished, this motherfucker… some wild shit.
Wrote a manifesto, you know where this is going.
And in that manifesto, he called me a genius.
Me.
 Dave Chappelle.
Not just me, but me.
----Punchline----
He’s a Kevin Hart fan too.

 I couldn’t even pay my bills.
 You know what I did to make money? I used to do shows for drug dealers that wanted to clean their money up.
 One time I did a real good set, and these motherfuckers called me in the back room.
 They gave me $25,000 in cash.
 I was probably 18, 19 years old.
 I was scared.
 I thanked them profusely, I put that money in my backpack, I jumped on the subway and started heading towards Brooklyn at one in the morning.
 Never been that terrified in my life.
 Because I’d never in my life had something that somebody else would want.

 Then I thought, “Holy shit.

   You say yes? I’m sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
 I just— I don’t know.
 I don’t know about this one.
 First of all, black people generally don’t trust doctors.
 After the Tuskegee experiments and all that shit.
 More importantly, don’t forget Michael Jackson was killed by a doctor.
 Granted, he was doing drugs.
 But if I was a heroin addict and I had a licensed physician injecting heroin in me, I should survive that.
 I’d just be like, “I’m good, right? I’m good? It’s not too much, is it?”
 Dr.
 Butterfingers killed Michael Jackson.
 After that, I was like, “Fuck going to the doctor.”
Why the fuck am I getting my kids vaccinated for an old-ass disease like measles? You might as well give them a diarrhea shot if you’re so worried.
 Diarrhea has a bigger body count than the measles do.
 You know, diarrhea is funny today, but… a hundred years ago, if your ass had diarrhea, you were a goner.
 There was a zero chance of surviving.
 You get that first squirt.
 Pfft! Uh-oh.
 “Better start getting my affairs in order.
 I don’t have much time.
 It’s diarrhea.
 It’s very serious.”
 You just watch your buddy slowly die in a pool of his own shit.
 Pfft! “Oh.
 Oh.
 I give up, diarrhea.”
 Pfffft! “You’re too strong.”
 Pfft! Nowadays, your buddy would be like, “You got diarrhea? Just eat a banana, nigga.
 Drink some water.
 Let’s get to the club.
 We can still make last call.”
Tough time for the blacks.
 These are not good times for the blacks.
 You know what I’m talking about, right? Police are killing us again.
 It’s a very unfortunate set of circumstances, because we were doing very well.
 You know, America has a racial hot seat.
 I think we can all agree that’s the truth.
 And we can also agree that that hot seat is traditionally occupied by African-Americans in general, African-American men in particular.
 Although, I can see that, in recent years, that seat has been occupied by Mexicans… and I daresay Arabs.
 And we, the black Americans, would like to thank you both for your sacrifice and your struggle.
 We needed a break.
 We needed a goddamn break.
 We all go through something, but at least I can leave my backpack someplace.
 If you’re Arab and forget a backpack, you got about 20 minutes before they send that robot to blow your shit up.
 You can kiss all that Engineering homework good-bye, Fouhad.
Now ISIS is number one on the terrorist charts.
 And ISIS is fucking scary.
 ‘Cause if ISIS catches you, they’re going to cut your head off.
 That’s what they do.
 I’ve seen them do it on YouTube.
 It was fucking awful.
 He looked right into the camera and said, “Obama, I am back.”

 How is this guy cutting people’s heads off on YouTube? I can’t even post a dick pic, and this motherfucker is decapitating people.
 I’m gonna have to change my settings.
You know, everyone has it hard.
 But I think, harder than black people and harder than Arabs and Mexicans, you know who has it the worst? Fat black people.
 It’s hard for white people to understand, but what I’m saying is very true.
 Fat black people have a really rough road, because all manner of things kill white people.
 But you know what kills more black people than anything, more than police and terrorism? Salt, nigga.
 Regular-ass table salt.
 Here, white people are getting Ebola cures and shit, and meanwhile, I’m dying from fucking flavoring.
Look, honestly, I’ll stop talking about it.
 Let me say this, though.
 Let me just say this.
 Can we all just say that we’ve seen it coming? Were you surprised? It’s like when that guy threw that banana at me.
 Do you think I was surprised? Hell no.
 I’ve been in show business 30 years.
 I was expecting this banana.
 I knew one of these nights— I was like, “Somebody’s gonna throw a banana at me one of these nights.”
‘Cause that’s how it starts, with the name-calling.
 Like that Paula Deen.
 Remember Paula Deen got fired from the Food Network? If you know anything about show business, it is really hard to get fired from the fucking Food Network.
 And they dropped that bitch like a hot potato.
 All because she called somebody an N-word 30 years before she had a show.
 I don’t know who she said it to, but whoever it was was just looking at her like, “I’m gonna get you for this, bitch.”
 That shit came back 30 years later like a Bill Cosby rape and sunk her battleship.
 And every black person was mad, but we weren’t that mad.
 It was more confusing than it was infuriating.
 I was just like, “Well, how is this bitch gonna call me a nigger when she taught me how to fry chicken? That’s not fair.”
I think Donald Sterling‘s shit was more serious.
 Remember Donald Sterling? He used to own the Clippers, and then he got caught on a secretly recorded tape saying some very unsavory things about African-Americans.
 And there’s a lesson in that for all of us.
 The lesson is if you are old and white and racist in this great country, whatever you do… don’t tell your black girlfriend about that shit.
 Because… that’s who made the tape.
 She recorded all that shit.
 And the tape was terrible.
 He was like, “Stop bringing black guys to my games.”
 At first, we were all confused.
 “How the fuck are you gonna have a game without us?”
But it turned out that the black guy he was speaking of was none other than Magic Johnson, the billionaire! Unbelievable.
 Never even mentioned the fact that he had AIDS, which is the first thing I would’ve said to my girlfriend.
 This guy must be really racist if AIDS is the footnote.
 “You gotta be careful, baby.
----Punchline----
 He got the old Ebola.”
