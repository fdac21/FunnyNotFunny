Got murdered by one police officer while five of his fellow officers watched him do it.
[no audio]
Not one of them said, “Frank, Frank take it easy.”
 None of that shit.
 Because they were being recorded.
 Because they were afraid if I correct my fellow officer on this camera it’s going to open us up for some kind of liability.
 And the guy killed the person that they were, uh, what do you call it? Apprehending? The guy was selling loose cigarettes.
There goes Eric Garner.
[sigh]
 And then we have one after the other.
Trayvon Martin gets murdered by just a regular nigga that… George Zimmerman is nobody.
George Zimmerman is an awful human being.
 He threatened Beyonce’s life, he threatened Jay-Z’s life, he signed Skittle bags because Trayvon Martin had Skittles on him when he was murdered by George Zimmerman.
 Boy, how do we feel?How do we feel right now? This kid was 15 years old being followed by a grown man with a gun and whooped his monkey ass.
 He beat the shit out of George Zimmerman and George Zimmerman murdered him, I’m very upset.
 This kid looked eerily like the president, he looked like my own children.
 I hate George Zimmerman.
 As an idea.
 Not as a guy, I’ve never met him.

Hit the streets.
 You got them marching.
 Dylann Roof.
 Dylann Roof killed eight people in a church in Charleston, South Carolina.
 He prayed with them first, and then he shot them at point-blank range.
It goes on and on.
 And in one weekend a law abiding citizen right here in Beaver Creek is murdered.
 The cop that murdered John Crawford pulled me over the night before and let me off with a warning.
 And the next day, kills a kid.
 He says, drop the weapon, bang bang bang.
This kid didn’t even have enough time to register that he was the one being spoken to.
This is our home town.
 It happened right here.
 I was very proud to be your neighbor, I love the way you guys hit those streets.
 We said his name and we tried to make sure everyone remembered him but he got lost in the sauce.
 And this guy John Crawford was a saint.
 He was there buying shit so him and his kids could make s’mores.
Michael Brown got shot the same week, and Michael Brown became the story.
And then, am I boring you?Well then, right back in Minneapolis was Philando Castile.
 Law abiding citizen, was a registered gun carrier, was trying to show police the paperwork for his registered weapon and was murdered in front of his wife and his child and then right in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, just two days later it happens again.
 And what do you think is going to happen? Three days later nine cops get murdered in Dallas at a Black Lives Matter rally.
Wow, I’ll never forget it.
 It was the first time I ever thought, I gotta get my family the fuck out of this place.
 These niggas will never understand.
 I’m tired of explaining to these people something that’s so goddamn obvious.
The guy that killed those nine cops, just like Chris Dorner before him, was from our military.
And then right after he did it, another four cops were shot dead in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Again, a Black man, that served in our military.
 What are they doing? Why would our guys do that?Black people from the military? Because they believe, just like they did when they were joining the fucking military, that they were fighting acts of terror.
   These are our people.
 These are our countrymen.
If I were white, and saw one of these men get murdered and I was in the NRA why wouldn’t I stand up for them.
 A card carrying legal gun owner that gets murdered in cold blood?Because he’s Black.
That’s why they don’t give a fuck.
There’s only one time the NRA ever supported an assault weapon ban.
----Punchline----
You know when it was? It was when the Black Panthers stormed the state capital with assault rifles in California.

 Oh, subway tiles? Word.

 Piqued my interest.
 She says, “My daughter is coming home for the holidays.”
 Like, “Oh, that is great news, I’m glad you’re not going to be alone.”
 And then she goes on and on about how great her daughter is.

 They gave me $25,000 in cash.
 I was probably 18, 19 years old.
 I was scared.
 I thanked them profusely, I put that money in my backpack, I jumped on the subway and started heading towards Brooklyn at one in the morning.
 Never been that terrified in my life.

You know, that’s a huge omission from this narrative.

 Matthew’s from France.
 He’s white.
 And yet, he has an original copy of this book written by a black American who was a pimp in the ’40s.
 Iceberg Slim.
 His real name was Robert Beck.
 He got the name Iceberg because he was in a bar in Chicago, and there was a shootout in the bar, and a bullet went through this nigga’s hat, and he still finished his drink.
 Pimps love shit like that.
 They said, “Man, you’re ice cold.”
