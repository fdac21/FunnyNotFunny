 I didn’t watch the tape for a week.
 I didn’t watch it.
 I knew.
 I saw a still picture, I said, I don’t want to see this, because I can’t unsee it.
 But when I finally watched it, I understood, nobody’s going home.
 Anyone who sees this, well they’re going to be furious.
So the other night, I’m in my little clubhouse.
 And I’m watching Don Lemon, that hotbed of reality.
He says, “Where are all these celebrities? Why aren’t you talking?”

I dare you!Has anyone ever listened to me do comedy?Have I not ever said anything about these things before?So, now, all the sudden, this nigga expects me to step in front of the streets and talk over the work these people are doing? As a celebrity? Answer me, do you want to see a celebrity right now? Do we give a fuck what Ja Rule thinks? Does it matter about celebrity? No! This is the streets talking for themselves.

During the process of executing this warrant, this white woman did what Chris Dorner thought was excessive force.

 She kicked the mother fucker that was handcuffed, or hit a guy that was handcuffed, or something.
 Chris Dorner, the Black police officer that watched this white woman do this, reported this to his superior.
 Made a formal complaint.
 And was subsequently fired from the LA PD.
He went through the system.
He took every legal avenue he believed he had to get reinstated.
And he was not reinstated.
And when his last appeal was finished, this motherfucker… some wild shit.
Wrote a manifesto, you know where this is going.
And in that manifesto, he called me a genius.

 Well, that’s an ominous thing to say.
And he did it.
This motherfucker, ambushed two police officers who just sitting in their squad car.
 Murdered them.
 He went to another police officer’s house and killed his daughter.
Boy, it was terrifying.
And this motherfucker was on the run.
 He was doing it.
 I was supposed to do the GRAMMYs.
 I was supposed to present at the GRAMMYs that week, and a guy from the LA PD called me and said, “Mr.
 Chappelle we understand you’re coming to Los Angeles, and I don’t know if you know, but there is a lunatic on the streets who is killing police officers and we would like to know if we can pick you up at the airport? We are extending this courtesy to everyone he mentioned in his manifesto.

Hit the streets.
 You got them marching.
 Dylann Roof.
 Dylann Roof killed eight people in a church in Charleston, South Carolina.
 He prayed with them first, and then he shot them at point-blank range.
It goes on and on.
 And in one weekend a law abiding citizen right here in Beaver Creek is murdered.
 The cop that murdered John Crawford pulled me over the night before and let me off with a warning.
 And the next day, kills a kid.
 He says, drop the weapon, bang bang bang.
This kid didn’t even have enough time to register that he was the one being spoken to.
This is our home town.
 It happened right here.
 I was very proud to be your neighbor, I love the way you guys hit those streets.
 We said his name and we tried to make sure everyone remembered him but he got lost in the sauce.
 And this guy John Crawford was a saint.
 He was there buying shit so him and his kids could make s’mores.
Michael Brown got shot the same week, and Michael Brown became the story.
And then, am I boring you?Well then, right back in Minneapolis was Philando Castile.
 Law abiding citizen, was a registered gun carrier, was trying to show police the paperwork for his registered weapon and was murdered in front of his wife and his child and then right in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, just two days later it happens again.
 And what do you think is going to happen? Three days later nine cops get murdered in Dallas at a Black Lives Matter rally.
Wow, I’ll never forget it.
 It was the first time I ever thought, I gotta get my family the fuck out of this place.
 These niggas will never understand.
 I’m tired of explaining to these people something that’s so goddamn obvious.
The guy that killed those nine cops, just like Chris Dorner before him, was from our military.
And then right after he did it, another four cops were shot dead in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Again, a Black man, that served in our military.
 What are they doing? Why would our guys do that?Black people from the military? Because they believe, just like they did when they were joining the fucking military, that they were fighting acts of terror.
   These are our people.
 These are our countrymen.
If I were white, and saw one of these men get murdered and I was in the NRA why wouldn’t I stand up for them.
 A card carrying legal gun owner that gets murdered in cold blood?Because he’s Black.
That’s why they don’t give a fuck.
There’s only one time the NRA ever supported an assault weapon ban.

 Ew! Baby, what are you doing? Now I looked over the table that she came from, and I peeped game.
 The men at the table were filming me.
 This happens when you’re famous.
 People will come over and try to rattle your cage and get you to say something stupid or dumb so that their buddies can film it and get a video of you embarrassing yourself.
 And clearly I said, “This is what is happening.”
----Punchline----

Sadly it worked.
I ran right over there, I said… I pointed right in the camera I said, “You is a bitch-ass nigga for doing this to me.”

 Webster’s defines a feminist as a human being, not a woman, a human being, that believes in equal rights for women.

   Juneteenth is a strange holiday, isn’t it?[audience]
 Yes.
It commemorates when Black people in Texarkana area of the country first found out that they were free.
 But remember, they were free when they found out.
 They just didn’t know it yet.
 Very interesting holiday.
 You know, I learned something This is a wild story.
 I learned this past Juneteenth of a story, this is true.
 And it’s that there was a Black man who was in South Carolina during slavery who somehow got granted his freedom by his so-called master.
 And when his master granted him the freedom he also gave him a plot of land.
 Now it turns out, this brother was brilliant.
 He had a good eye, good knack for farming.
 And he farmed this plot of land very successfully and made a lot of money, and this is where the story gets crazy.
----Punchline----
 When he got all that money… this nigga brought some slaves.

 Misquoted the jokes, and was calling me transphobic you know, these words, I had never heard them before but every time that I talked with anybody from the community since they always repeat the talking points from that article.
 My least favorite of which being, I hate this phrase they say, “I was punching down on them.”
 “Punching down”, what the fuck does that mean? Now fast forward.
