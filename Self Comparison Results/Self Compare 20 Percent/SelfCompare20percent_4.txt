I’m just kidding.
They’re not really even riots.
 You notice that?[sighs]
 This is a fucking weird time.
Mhmm.
In like 1993, I’m not sure what year it was, but I was in LA.
 I had smoked a joint and I was watching a movie, Apocalypse Now.
 It was like just after 4:00 in the morning.
 And what later would become the known Northridge earthquake happened.
 It felt like it started in my apartment.
You know? I’m from east of the Mississippi.
 On this side we don’t know what earthquakes are about.
 I got to tell you something, man [burps]
Excuse me, burping.
This shit was terrifying.
 It was absolutely terrifying.
Uh, a lot of things went through my mind, I was like, not naked, but you know what I mean, just chilling in my boxers.
 Uh, I put my clothes on, I found my weed.
 And some, a pipe, and a lighter and some money, and my keys, all these things, while the earthquake is happening, while I’m experiencing what an earthquake is for the first time, and I was certain that I might very possibly die.
 As a matter of fact, I remember I made a point not to scream, just in case I lived, I wouldn’t have to remember myself being vocally terrified.
 But I forgave myself for being terrified.
 That earthquake couldn’t have been more than 35 seconds.
 This man kneeled on a man’s neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds! Can you imagine that!? This kid thought he was going to die.
 He knew he was going to die.
 He called for his mother.
 He called for his dead mother.
 I’ve only seen that once before in my life, my father, on his deathbed, called for his grandmother.
 When I watched that tape I understood this man knew he was going to die.
 People watched it, people filmed it, and for some reason, that I still don’t understand, all these fucking police had their hands in their pockets.
Who.
 Are.
 You.
 Talking.
 To!What are you signifying? That you can kneel on a man’s neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds and feel like you wouldn’t get the wrath of God.
 That’s what is happening right now.
   It’s not for a single cop, it’s for all of it.
 Fucking all of it.
 I don’t mean to get heavy, but.
----Punchline----

He said, “Please!”

 I didn’t watch the tape for a week.
 I didn’t watch it.
 I knew.
 I saw a still picture, I said, I don’t want to see this, because I can’t unsee it.
 But when I finally watched it, I understood, nobody’s going home.
 Anyone who sees this, well they’re going to be furious.
So the other night, I’m in my little clubhouse.

 You know, you know what I was thinking about all day today? This is really weird.
 First of all, I’m nervous.
 I should tell you that.
 You can’t tell, but, all inside.
 I was thinking about a person I never actually met, but I heard about all my life.
 I was thinking about my great grandfather, who apparently, by all accounts, was a very great man.
 He was born a slave in South Carolina.
 Was a slave for ten years of his life.
 And when the northerners came down, they started educating some of the newly freed black children, and he learned how to read.
 Got enamored with education and dedicated his life to three things: Education, freedom of black people, Jesus Christ.
 Became a juggernaut in the AME Church.
 It was a pretty amazing story my great grandfather had, and I thought about him all day today because I wish I could see him now.
 And I wish he could see me, because I wonder what he would say.
 This week I flew to New York on a private jet to host the Saturday Night Live.
 Netflix started streaming a show that bears his name, The Chappelle Show.
 And HBO Max is streaming it.

And she was very gracious.
 She said “Thank you so much”, and we shook hands and as she was shaking my hand, her face turned mean, like her mom’s.
 And she said, “Do you mind, not punching down on my people?”
 Oh, I don’t like that.

 Any of you, who have ever watched me know that I’ve never had a problem with transgender people.
----Punchline----
 If you listen to what I’m saying, clearly my problem has always been with White people.

 Especially the trans jokes, very puzzling… because she was obviously trans.
 And one night after one of the shows I met her.
 And what it was, turns out it was her dream to be a comedian.
 And I was her hero.
 It was very moving.
 I could not dislike somebody that felt that way about me.
 We became fast friends.
 And when I made that special Sticks and Stones right as it was coming out, I happened to be in San Francisco and I wanted to do a show.
 But I needed an opening act, and I remembered… that trans woman I had met, so I called her on the phone.
 And I called her myself, I said, “Hey Daphne, this is Dave Chappelle.”
 She couldn’t believe it.
 And I go, “I’m in San Francisco.”

Boy, when she said that shit, it blew the roof of the place.
 Cut through all the tension, with that one joke.
 She had made up for 45 minutes of a stinker of a show.
 And after that, she could do no wrong.
 And I kept on rocking, and she kept on talking to me.
 And then the show became something cooler than a show.
 It became like a conversation between a Black man and a White trans woman and we started getting to the bottom of shit.
 All of them questions that you think about that you’d be afraid to ask, I was just asking them and she was answering them and her answers were funny as shit.
 The crowd was falling out of their chairs and at the end of the show, I go, “Well, Daphne”… I said “Well, that was fun.”
 I go, “I love you to death, but I have no fuckin’ idea what you’re talking about.”
 The whole crow laughed except for Daphne.
 Man, she looks at me like I’m not her friend anymore.
 Like I’m something bigger than me, like I’m the whole world in a guy.
 Then she said, “I don’t need you to understand me.”
 I said, “What?”
 She said, “I just need you to believe…” Just like that she goes, “…that I’m having a human experience.”
 And when she said it the whole crowd kind of gasped.
 And I gave the Fight Club look.
----Punchline----
 I said, “I believe you, bitch.”

 I’m just saying, I’m held to a higher standard of accountability than these women are.


Don’t forget who I am.
 Don’t forget what I am.
 I am a black dude.
 And don’t ever forget how I got here.
 My ancestors were kidnapped.
 I don’t even know where the fuck I’m from.
 They were put on the bottom of boats.
 They sailed them across the Atlantic.
 Many of them died.
 Only the strongest survived.
 And once they got here, they beat the humanity out of my people.
 They turned us into beasts of burdens.
 They made us do their work, and the irony is, hundreds of years later they’re calling us lazy.
 We fought in the Civil War.
 We damn near freed ourselves.
 Then, with Reconstruction, black people did great.
 My great-grandfather was a very wealthy man.
 But then the Black Codes came, Jim Crow came, and it was a hundred years of unspeakable oppression again.
 Lynchings, all kinds of terroristic acts to keep us in the margins of society.
 Yet, we still fought.
 And Dr. King was born.
 And then, things got better.
 Twenty years after Dr. King was assassinated, Michael Jackson was moonwalking on television.
 Something, something, something.
----Punchline----
 Barack Obama.
