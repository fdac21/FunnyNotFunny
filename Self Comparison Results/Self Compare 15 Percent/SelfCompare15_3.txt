 I didn’t watch the tape for a week.
 I didn’t watch it.
 I knew.
 I saw a still picture, I said, I don’t want to see this, because I can’t unsee it.
 But when I finally watched it, I understood, nobody’s going home.
 Anyone who sees this, well they’re going to be furious.
So the other night, I’m in my little clubhouse.
 And I’m watching Don Lemon, that hotbed of reality.
He says, “Where are all these celebrities? Why aren’t you talking?”

This nigga said everybody.
----Tagline(s)----
I dare you!Has anyone ever listened to me do comedy?Have I not ever said anything about these things before?So, now, all the sudden, this nigga expects me to step in front of the streets and talk over the work these people are doing? As a celebrity? Answer me, do you want to see a celebrity right now? Do we give a fuck what Ja Rule thinks? Does it matter about celebrity? No! This is the streets talking for themselves.

During the process of executing this warrant, this white woman did what Chris Dorner thought was excessive force.
 I don’t know what she did.
 She kicked the mother fucker that was handcuffed, or hit a guy that was handcuffed, or something.
 Chris Dorner, the Black police officer that watched this white woman do this, reported this to his superior.
 Made a formal complaint.
 And was subsequently fired from the LA PD.
He went through the system.
He took every legal avenue he believed he had to get reinstated.
And he was not reinstated.
And when his last appeal was finished, this motherfucker… some wild shit.
Wrote a manifesto, you know where this is going.
And in that manifesto, he called me a genius.
Me.
 Dave Chappelle.
Not just me, but me.

 I didn’t even know that was possible.
 Jesus Christ.
 He got the guy from Star Trek: The Next Generation.
 That’s who he– that’s who he got.
 The last time.
 It sounded like he was more than that, but… that’s who– that’s who set it off.
 He was 14-years-old.
 And Kevin Spacey accosted him at a party, which I gotta say, by the way, just for the record, I went to a lot of parties in my day.
----Punchline----
 Never been to a good one that had 14-year-old boys in it.
----Tagline(s)----
 Not even when I was 13, you know what I mean.

 Yuck.
 Ironically, the kid grew up to be gay anyway.
 Which means… Kevin Spacey can sniff that shit out like a truffle pig.
 [sniffs]
 “Yeah, he’s one of me.”
----Punchline----
 And not to victim blame, but it seems like the kind of situation that a gay 14-year-old would get himself into.

 That’s not what happens.
 It was cold out there.
 For real, I had to watch it all go down without me.
 I had to watch all those people do my show.
 Key & Peele and Amy Schumer and… Mind of Mencia.
 I’m not gonna say they were doing my show.
 I’m just saying they were awfully similar.
 I was mad.
 People would come up to me on the street, “Yo, nigga.”
 Most people thought I was crazy, but sometimes people come, “Yo, nigga, you did the right thing, man.
 You my hero.”
 Nigga, I don’t want to be your hero.

 I want to be rich.

Iceberg Slim breaks down some of the coldest capitalist concepts I’ve ever heard in my life.
 He describes in detail how these men break women so that they will give them the money that they make with their own bodies.
 There’s a story in here so cold, it makes me shudder to think about it.
 Iceberg Slim is trying to control the woman that he finds uncontrollable.
 So he asks an older pimp how he can rein her in.
 And the older pimp says, “Oh, that’s easy, Iceberg.
 All you have to do is beat that bitch with a coat hanger.
 And then run her a bath.
 And give her some pills.
 She’ll be so grateful that you fixed her, that she’ll forget you were the motherfucker that beat her in the first place.”
 That’s some cold shit.
Now.
 At the end of this book, Iceberg Slim tells a story.
 It’s kind of the crescendo of the book.
 And in the story, Iceberg Slim’s bottom bitch is at the end of her mileage.
----Punchline----
 If she was good for 500 fucks, she was at for 498.

 I got one last trick for you.
 It’s a big money trick.
 You do this for me, you get paid, I get paid, and we go our separate ways.”
 She said, “Fine, motherfucker, what do you want me to do?”
 He said, “Okay, there’s a guy in that hotel across the street.
 He’s waiting for you in room number seven.
 I want you to go over there and fuck him.
 But before you do, I need to put some of this stuff in his drink.
 And then he’s gonna fall asleep.
 When he does, his briefcase on his bed, bring the briefcase to me.
 That’s the trick, bitch.
 Can you handle it?”
 She said, “Fuck yeah, I can.
 I can’t wait to get rid of you.”
----Punchline----
 And then she ran outside, jumped on a unicycle and peddled across the street.

Pretty damn good.
 I was in Santa Fe the other night, and a motherfucker threw a banana peel at me.
 Yeah, that didn’t feel so good.
 Of course, it was a white person.
 Not to indict the whites.
 I’m just saying.
 Not to profile.
 And then, not only did he throw a banana peel at me, but… it was premeditated.
 You could tell.
 You could tell.
 The peel was too brown.
 You know what I mean? You didn’t eat that banana recently, motherfucker.
 You had that shit waiting on me.
 And the whole crowd was white, so it just got instantly creepy, and everyone looked like they were looking at 12 Years a Slave.
----Punchline----
 They were all just like… Who the fuck does that? And then they arrested the guy, which was…
