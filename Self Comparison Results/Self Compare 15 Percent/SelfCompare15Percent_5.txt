I’m just kidding.
They’re not really even riots.
 You notice that?[sighs]
 This is a fucking weird time.
Mhmm.
In like 1993, I’m not sure what year it was, but I was in LA.
 I had smoked a joint and I was watching a movie, Apocalypse Now.
 It was like just after 4:00 in the morning.
 And what later would become the known Northridge earthquake happened.
 It felt like it started in my apartment.
You know? I’m from east of the Mississippi.
 On this side we don’t know what earthquakes are about.
 I got to tell you something, man [burps]
Excuse me, burping.
This shit was terrifying.
 It was absolutely terrifying.
Uh, a lot of things went through my mind, I was like, not naked, but you know what I mean, just chilling in my boxers.
 Uh, I put my clothes on, I found my weed.
 And some, a pipe, and a lighter and some money, and my keys, all these things, while the earthquake is happening, while I’m experiencing what an earthquake is for the first time, and I was certain that I might very possibly die.
 As a matter of fact, I remember I made a point not to scream, just in case I lived, I wouldn’t have to remember myself being vocally terrified.
 But I forgave myself for being terrified.
 That earthquake couldn’t have been more than 35 seconds.
 This man kneeled on a man’s neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds! Can you imagine that!? This kid thought he was going to die.
 He knew he was going to die.
 He called for his mother.
 He called for his dead mother.
 I’ve only seen that once before in my life, my father, on his deathbed, called for his grandmother.
 When I watched that tape I understood this man knew he was going to die.
 People watched it, people filmed it, and for some reason, that I still don’t understand, all these fucking police had their hands in their pockets.
Who.
 Are.
 You.
 Talking.
 To!What are you signifying? That you can kneel on a man’s neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds and feel like you wouldn’t get the wrath of God.
 That’s what is happening right now.
   It’s not for a single cop, it’s for all of it.
 Fucking all of it.
 I don’t mean to get heavy, but.
----Punchline----
We gotta say something.

During the process of executing this warrant, this white woman did what Chris Dorner thought was excessive force.
 I don’t know what she did.
 She kicked the mother fucker that was handcuffed, or hit a guy that was handcuffed, or something.
 Chris Dorner, the Black police officer that watched this white woman do this, reported this to his superior.
 Made a formal complaint.
 And was subsequently fired from the LA PD.
He went through the system.
He took every legal avenue he believed he had to get reinstated.
And he was not reinstated.
And when his last appeal was finished, this motherfucker… some wild shit.
Wrote a manifesto, you know where this is going.
And in that manifesto, he called me a genius.
Me.
 Dave Chappelle.
Not just me, but me.

 Because they were being recorded.

 And the guy killed the person that they were, uh, what do you call it? Apprehending? The guy was selling loose cigarettes.
There goes Eric Garner.

 And then we have one after the other.
Trayvon Martin gets murdered by just a regular nigga that… George Zimmerman is nobody.
George Zimmerman is an awful human being.
 He threatened Beyonce’s life, he threatened Jay-Z’s life, he signed Skittle bags because Trayvon Martin had Skittles on him when he was murdered by George Zimmerman.
 Boy, how do we feel?How do we feel right now? This kid was 15 years old being followed by a grown man with a gun and whooped his monkey ass.
 He beat the shit out of George Zimmerman and George Zimmerman murdered him, I’m very upset.

All jokes aside, Kevin Spacey shouldn’t have done that shit to that kid.
 He was 14-years-old and was forced to carry a grown man’s secret.
 For 30 years.
 Jesus Christ, he must have been busting at the seams with that one.
----Punchline----
 The saddest part is, if he were able to carry that secret for six more months, I would get to know how House of Cards ends.

 A lot of black dudes haven’t been getting “me too-ed.”
 I don’t want to jinx myself.
 You know why, though? Obviously, black women go through the same thing, right? The reason is because black women from slavery won’t tell on us.
 Because they know that no matter how bad we black dudes are, white dudes are very mean.
 They’re scared to see us get punished.
 My wife is Asian.
----Punchline----
 She’d tell on me in a goddamn second.

You know, that’s a huge omission from this narrative.
 This wouldn’t have gone this far if some women weren’t willing to do it.
 You can’t ask every woman to hold the line.
 Some women can carry things heavier than others.
 So we should fight for one another.
 We should forgive the ones of us that are weaker and support the ones of us that are stronger.
 And then we can beat the thing.
 If you guys keep going after individuals, the system is going to stay intact.
 You have to have men on your side.
 And I’m telling you right now, you’re gonna have a lot of imperfect allies.
I’ll tell you what happened, but I can’t say it directly.
 There’s a book to me that encapsulates my entire experience.
 Before I left the show.
 And the book is called Pimp.
 It’s written by a guy named Iceberg Slim.
 Yeah, bring it up here.
 This is Matthew.
 Matthew’s from France.
 He’s white.
 And yet, he has an original copy of this book written by a black American who was a pimp in the ’40s.
 Iceberg Slim.
 His real name was Robert Beck.
 He got the name Iceberg because he was in a bar in Chicago, and there was a shootout in the bar, and a bullet went through this nigga’s hat, and he still finished his drink.
 Pimps love shit like that.
 They said, “Man, you’re ice cold.”
 And he said, “I like that.”
 And it stuck.
----Punchline----
This book is so heavy in the front and has a glossary of pimp terms, because the ideas are so foreign to the American ears.

 He had to let her go.
 It was hard to let a bottom bitch go, and he wasn’t ready to let her go because his organization couldn’t handle losing her.
 But she didn’t know that.
 She didn’t know how important she was.
 So what he did was, he called her to ignite her.
 He said, “Look, bitch, you and I got to part ways.”
 She said, “Fine, motherfucker, I don’t need you anyway, because I know somebody at Ringling Brothers.”

 He was like, “All right, whatever.

 You can say what you want about that girl, but I’m gonna tell you right now she is a goddamn hero.
 You might’ve thought these things were happening before, but now you can see it all in front of you without a shadow of a doubt.
 That shit actually went down.
 She sucked that old guy’s dick.
 She really took one for the team on that one.
 That’s really gross.
 His dick is, like, 80 years old.
 It’s like tasting history.
 Like, five wars on it, the Civil Rights Movement, the Great Depression.
 This guy’s been fucking from 40 years before Bill Cosby‘s first rape.
 It’s a very old man.
 A very old penis.
But all that shit is still just name-calling.
 Like, name-calling does not break the modern black man.
 That’s not gonna do the trick.
 I don’t give a fuck about that.
 If I went to Kentucky Fried Chicken, and for some reason, everyone behind the counter had a Ku Klux Klan hood on top of their head, what do you think I’m gonna do in this day and age? Run out of Kentucky Fried Chicken? Not if I’m hungry.
 I’ll go straight to the front.
 “Hey, man.
 Let me get a two-piece.”
 I don’t give a fuck what he says.
 “You want a biscuit with that, nigger?”
 “I thought it came with a biscuit.
 What’s all this attitude? I want a two-piece.
 Chop, chop.
 You know what it is.”
 But I’m not gonna be mad.
 Why would I be mad? He’s the one that’s gotta work at Kentucky Fried Chicken, not me.
How about this? What if I lived in Austin and I had a white girlfriend? It’s possible in Austin.
 As a matter of fact, some people say it’s necessary.
 But that’s not the point.
 And me and my white girlfriend are at home one night, and we’re just doing what lovers do.
 Maybe she’s butt-naked and she’s down on one knee, giving me a hand-job.
 I love a good hand-job.
 And she’s really jerking me off.
 You know, getting her obliques nice and tight.
 I got a huge dick, so she’s like… 
[grunting]
 And I’m like, “Wow, this really feels wonderful.
 I think I’m gonna come.”
 And then she looks up at me and goes, “Come in my face… nigger.”
 I know, that’s a tough one.
 Well, what do you think I’m gonna do? “Hey!”
 That’s no time for integrity, ladies and gentlemen.
 I’m busting that nut in her face.
 I’ll sort through the ethics later.
 But I’m what they call a man of his word.
 If I say I’m coming, I’m coming.
 I don’t give a fuck what happens.
 God forbid, somebody could shoot me.
 If I say I’m coming, there’s still that— [imitates gunshot]
 It doesn’t mean I like getting shot.
Oh, boy.
 Yeah, a tough time for the blacks.
 I’m not gonna say nothing about the police.
 I’ll leave that for Chris Rock.
The other big sports story was, fucking, Ray Rice’s tape.
 Anyone see that Ray Rice tape? I can’t stop watching it.
 It’s fucking awful.
 It’s the most violent thing I’ve seen happen to a woman that was shot in color.
 Really fucking bad.
 If I could’ve froze time at that moment and gave Ray Rice some advice, I don’t think there’s any way possible I’d be like… “You should punch her in the face.”
 That’s a fucking terrible idea.
 At the same time, I also believe she shouldn’t have rushed him.
 What the fuck? You can’t beat him.
 Don’t rush a motherfucker that’s trained to stiff-arm people in the clutch.
 He’s gonna get the upper hand.
The only reason I bring him up is because he’s about to play football again.
 You didn’t know that? The NFL was told by a federal judge they had to reinstate Ray Rice because he was transparent with their investigation.
 He told them exactly what he did.
 And they can’t just change their ruling just because the tape came out.
 I get it.
 That’s like if I’m hanging out with my buddies, and I’m like, “Hey, guys, guess what I did last night? I fucked this big, fat girl I met at the club.”
 And they’re all like, “Oh, shit, Dave.
 That’s crazy.”
 And then they see a tape of me doing it, and they’re like… “We can’t hang out with you anymore, Dave.
 That’s not what this crew is all about.”
 I’d be like, “What? I told y’all what I did.”
What’s really fucked up is the tape was made before they were married.
 Isn’t that weird? I don’t know why she’d do that.
 I don’t even know why he would do that.
 As a guy, would you want to live with a woman that you had once punched in the face with all your strength? That’s some very bold Color Purple-type shit.
 “Celie! Come out here and shave me!”
 Are you out of your fucking mind?I had to ask an older friend of mine, just to get some perspective, this older black dude.
 Actually the fairest person I’ve ever met.
 And I asked him.
 I just said, “Hey, man, did you see that Ray Rice video?”
 And instantly, he was like, “David, that shit was disgusting.”
 And then a moment later, he goes… “I wonder what she said to him.”
 I don’t think that matters.
 I think the idea is you’re not supposed to punch her in the face.
 Because my wife says terrible shit to me.
 My wife once called me a pussy… in front of dinner guests.
 I know.
 I started to get mad, but then I was like, “Fuck it.
 She’s probably right.”
 I am a pussy.
 I admit it.
 I’m soft and warm and persuasive, like a real pussy.
 That’s right.
 Then I told her, “If you don’t take care of me properly, I might stink, like your pussy.”
[crowd]
 Ohh!Oh, we fight dirty at the Chappelle household.
 It’s not a big deal.
No, no.
 If you want to get to the bottom of a matter of the heart, what you’re supposed to do is ask a woman.
 Now, actually, there’s two women that I know— they’re both college professors in this little area I live in, and I meet them twice a week at Starbucks for coffee.
 We talk about important shit.
 And I asked the girls— we was in a coffee klatch.
 I said, “Yo, why do y’all think that this woman stayed with Ray Rice after he punched her in the face with all his strength?”
 And one of my girlfriends said, “David, you need to wake the fuck up.
 She’s staying for the money.”
 Now, wait a minute, ’cause my other girlfriend was like, “I disagree.
 I think that she actually loves him.”
 And I said, “Wait a minute, ladies.
 You know what? I think that you’re both right.”
 And what I was doing when I said that was preserving the possibility of a threesome with these bitches.
 I’d been chipping away at this pussy one cup of coffee at a time for, like, four years.
 I wasn’t gonna throw that hard work away with some Ray Rice shit.
 I don’t care that much.
 I’m just being real.
It’s fucked up, man.
 It’s a tough time for the blacks.
[man]
 I love you, Dave!I love you, too.
 And then here comes the banana peel.
 I’m waiting on it any second.
 You know that’s how it starts.
 I saw in the paper today that the guy that threw the banana at me got arrested again ’cause he threw a banana at another motherfucker in a bar in Santa Fe.
 Look it up online after the show.
 He actually did that.
 And that guy was black, too.
 I’m just saying.
 And you know why the guy said he did it that night? He said, “I did it ’cause Dave Chappelle is racist.”
 So, nigga? That’s not the best way to handle that if I am racist.
 What if Martin Luther King just went around throwing tuna casserole on white people? Would that work?[woman shouting]
Huh?   Come on, Dave!Your girl’s bubbling.
 She’s drunk as hell, buddy.
 Listen, sir, I don’t know what she’s saying, but just take my advice.
 Get some water in her, or you’re gonna have some dry pussy when you get home.
 His dick’s gonna be chafed the fuck up tomorrow.
Santa Maria.
 Who got a cigarette in here? Anyone got a cigarette I can borrow? Yeah.
 You, fella.
 Yeah, please.
[crowd]
 Ohh!Let me see.
 This is a Marlboro menthol.
 This could’ve been anybody.
 If it was a Newport, I’d be like, “A black dude threw that up.”
 But a Marlboro menthol, that’s one of them riddles.
----Punchline----
 Oh.
