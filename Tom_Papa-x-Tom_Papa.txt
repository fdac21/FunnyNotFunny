But thank you for coming out.
 You look beautiful.
 I hope you’re doing alright.
 You look happy.
 I travel the whole country and everybody’s freaking out.
 Everywhere I go, people are doing deep yoga breaths in the airport.
 They’re downloading meditation apps on their phone, just trying to keep it together.
 Calm down, you’re doing great.
 You’re doing great.
 I’m telling you, you’re doing great.
 Life isn’t perfect.
 It never was, and it never will be.
 We’ve all got stuff to deal with.
 You’re doing great.
So what, you’re fat.
 Who cares? We’re all fat.
 You’re either really fat, kind of fat, or trying not to be fat.
 Either way, fat’s coming.
 And that’s alright.
 Don’t hate on it.
 You know why you’re fat? Because you’re winners.
 Yeah, first generation, born at the right time, doesn’t have to fight for survival.
 Food always within arm’s reach, perfect temperature everywhere you go.
 Every day you wake up in America, it’s a perfect 72 and snacky.
 So, yeah, we’re going to be a little chubby.
 Big deal.
 Don’t hate on it.
 Don’t hate on it.
 Accept you.
 This is it, guys.
You’re a grown-up.
 You’re an adult.
 This is what you ended up looking like.

 Well… you’re not an Olympic athlete.
 You’re Don from Sales.
 You got a fat ass, you wear khakis, you hike them up when you walk.

 So, don’t tell me what you’re quitting.
 I don’t care.
 I don’t care what your low self-esteem… decided you should quit this week.
 “I’m quitting meat.”
 “I’m quitting gluten.”

My wife quit sugar in January because she ate cookies like a monster… all through December, and on January 1st, came marching into the kitchen: “That’s it.
 I’m never eating sugar again.”
 [chuckling]
 “Yes, you are.”
 And you’re going to eat more than you ever ate before.
 Not because you’re weak, but because you’re a human being and you get sad sometimes.
 And to stop yourself from slitting your own throat, you eat a cookie once in a while.
I have friends in my life that don’t eat bread anymore.

Could you imagine? No toast in the morning with butter for the rest of your life? Kill yourself.
 Make some room for people who know how to live.
 I know it’s hard.
 I know, I feel the pressure too.
 Everyone in your face, telling you to do more, lose more weight, be better… I get it.
 I get it.
 They show you the ads for the gym, they show you to try to get you to join up, like the “Before” and “After” guy.
 I always like the “Before” guy, frankly.
 Yeah, he looks a little chubby.
 He also looks like he has a box of donuts and a lot of friends.
 That “After” guy’s got a weird look in his eye.
 Looks like he takes his shirt off when he shouldn’t.
They’re always getting in our face: “Yeah, well, other generations were skinnier.”
 Yeah? Well, their lives were miserable.
 Gandhi didn’t look like Gandhi because he was killing it at SoulCycle.
 He had a horrible life.
 He wore a diaper and ate butterflies for lunch.
Every show has a makeover segment on it now, right? They always take some woman, tell her she’s not good enough, and, therefore, no women watching are good enough.
 It’s always a mom… Always a mom.
 Just a worker.
 Right? Fifteen kids and 20 animals… driving around in her Cheerio-covered minivan.
 She didn’t think her life was going to go this way, no.
 She thought she was going to be a princess.
 That’s what they told her her whole life: “You’re a princess.”
 And on her wedding day, she thought she made it.
 They dressed her up like a snow queen.
 They took pictures of her next to the duck pond.
 She thought she did it.

But she doesn’t care.
 She loves this family, dedicates her life to these people.
 She’s an angel here on Earth.
 And what does her family do in return? They pop out of a pantry on national TV and scream in her face.
 ‘We’re giving you a makeover!”
 “I thought I looked okay.”
 “No, you’re disgusting.
 We had a meeting when you were making us lunch.
 We decided we’re not going to look at this anymore.”
Then they drag her ass to The Today Show.
 They put her in clothes she could never afford or wear.
 She can’t wear heels this big.
 They’re going to get stuck in the field when she’s putting up the soccer nets.
 Hair and makeup she could never replicate on her own without an extra three hours in the morning before the school bus comes.
 This is the worst part: On national TV, she comes waddling out in her heels, trying not to fall.
 Her whole family’s in front of her, they start crying, in her face.
 “Oh my God, you’re beautiful.
 You look nothing like you.”
Cut her a break.
 You’ve got to be nicer to each other.
 You’ve got to be nicer to yourself.
 This is hard.
 It’s hard what we’re doing, isn’t it? It’s hard being a person.
 Yeah.
 It’s hard.
 When I was little, I used to look at grown-ups with money and cars and think, “Wow, that looks fun.
 I can’t wait.”
 Then I was an adult for six weeks.
 I’m like, “This blows.
 “I have to pay for everything.”
 Just the physical maintenance of you every day, right? It’s endless.
 Just the brushing and cleaning and wiping… hopefully every day.
 It’s like you’re your own pet.
 And some people don’t take care of their pet very well.
 You see them on the sidewalk, their hair’s all matted, looks like they ate out of the garbage.
 “Where’s your collar, Dan?”
 “Aaah!”
God.
 Just the check list of stuff you’ve got to do to get out of the house.
 I mean, look around tonight.
 Right? Look around.
 No one’s killing it in here.
 You look alright, but no one’s like, “Wow, look at that guy.”
 And still, to look like this took some doing, didn’t it? Yeah.
 You made choices, put things back…[chuckling]
 I was walking down Sixth Avenue in New York, this businessman walking the other way.
 So well thought out, everything immaculate: suit, tie, leather shoes match his briefcase… glasses… not a hair out of place.
 Fly open, one ball out.
 I understood.
 He did everything on the list, didn’t check that one box.
 Just on his way to a meeting.
 Probably on his way back from a meeting, actually.
 No, that’s the other thing.
 As an adult, nobody cares.
 Nobody helps you.
 Probably looked him in the eye in the meeting.
 “I’m not telling him, I got my own problems.
 I think I’m wearing my wife’s underwear today.
 I don’t know what the hell’s going on.”
 His wife probably kissed him goodbye in the morning.
 “So long, honey.
 What a jackass.
 He’ll figure it out.
 If I’ve got to see it, so should everybody else.
 Wouldn’t hurt to get a little sun on that guy once in a while.”
[sighs]
 No one cares.
 We’re totally alone.
 You are.
 Even the people closest to you only get so close, right? The people you sleep next to, only so close.
 You’ve got to give yourself little pep talks in your head.
 All day long, like a crazy person.
 ‘Cause you’re the only one looking out for you.
 “I’ve got my wallet, got my cell phone.
 Okay, okay.
 [sighs]
 Where are my keys? Where are my keys? Okay, I’ve got my keys.
 Alright, it’s going to be a great day.
 It’s going to be a great day.”
 The only difference between you and a crazy person is they say it out loud on the street.
 [loudly]
 “I’ve got my wallet, got my cell phone… Going to be a great day!”
 You’re looking at him across the street, “This guy’s nuts.
 We don’t yell like that.

 It considers my fat face and my normal face to be two different people.

 Apparently, he owns the phone.

 You don’t even think you’re fat, and you’re like, “I’m a monster.”
 “How are they not just hitting me with a dart when I come out of the front door… and taking me to the zoo to be identified?”

 I don’t know why we don’t feel like we’re doing great.
 You work hard, do all the stuff you’re supposed to be doing.
 You’re doing your best, and still, you feel like it’s not enough.
 I think it’s social media.
 I think since social media came out.
 Before social media, I thought I was kicking ass.
 I really did.
 Now, every time I open my phone, someone’s in my face.
 “Are you killing it today?”
 “Are you living 100% maxed out energy?”
 “Are you living your best life?”
 No, I’m not.
 I’m not doing any of those things… because that’s not normal.
 I don’t care what The Rock’s Instagram says, that’s not normal.
You know what’s normal? How you feel right now.
 Right now, in your funny little gassy bodies.
 A little achy, a little tired, light-headed… taking deep breaths, so you don’t pass out in front of your friends.
 Worried about your bills, worried about how you’re getting home, worried about that thing you found on your ass.
 That’s normal.
 And it’s exhausting and that’s normal too.
 Being tired, which I know you are all the time.
 That is normal.
 You don’t need a five-hour energy drink.
 You need to lay down once in a while.
[audience whooping and applauding]
So, we beat ourselves up about it all the time.
 Right? All my friends… “I don’t know what’s wrong with me.
 Two o’clock in the afternoon, every day.
 I get so tired.

 Nothing.

 Yeah, that’s happening too, trust me.
And if your friend is douchey enough to post 50 pictures of their Hawaiian vacation while they know you’re at work, don’t get depressed, get even! Start posting pictures of you at their house.
 “Bob just peed in the pool.

 My friends and family.
 and I never get off Instagram or Facebook and think: “Wow, good for everyone!”
 No, I want them all to die.

 “Oh, ‘We’re partying again.

 “Oh, they’re in love.
 No, they’re not.
 He cheated on her last year.

We’ve got to control it, because it does get to you.
 It does.
 You see people with money and fame and you think, “What’s wrong with my life? Where did I screw up? Why aren’t I living like that?”
 No.
 No, that’s an illusion.
 A simple life is what wins.

 You run out of toothpaste.

 And once you started pedaling, you couldn’t stop.
 You pedaled till you died.

I made a horrible business decision.
 I got married and had two children.
 Horrible idea.
 I love them, but they just grow and get bigger and need more money and more money.
 At this point, it’s like I’m living with two unemployed coke addicts.
 Seriously, they come into my office every morning: “Hey, you got more money for me?”
 “What happened to the change from yesterday?’ “I don’t know.
 The economy, right?”
And I spoil them.
 I spoil the hell out of them.
 Because they’re girls.
 They’re two girls.
 So, forget it.
 They got me.
 Oh, they got me.
 I hope they don’t watch this and realize.
 No, they got me.
 And, you know, my father had money, but he didn’t spoil us, so I’m going the other way.
 You know? My father made money, but he was like, “I’m not going to give it to children.
 I’m going to spend it on what I want to spend it on.”
 Could you imagine living in a time where the children weren’t in charge? Sounds like a magical time to be alive.
 He took us to an amusement park once, he saw the line… He said, “Just look at it through the fence, you get the idea.”
My daughters make me take them out for ice cream three times a week.
 And I do it, like an idiot.
 Oh, they’re so entitled.
 They walk into that shop with the little sample spoons, the worst invention in retail.
 Just… Nom, nom, nom.
 “No.
 No” “Let me see if you did better with that one.”
 Nom, nom, nom.
 “No.”
 My father took us out for ice cream once.
 “Everyone gets one scoop of vanilla, no cones.
 Put out your hands.”
 [in English accent]
 “Thank you, Father.

 Man… But now the responsibility when you have these people… Sometimes late at night, when my wife is asleep and the kids are asleep and the animals are just dreaming peacefully, without a care in the world… and I’m standing naked, alone in the hallway, rapt with fear, because I know their lives depend on me.
 And I can’t tell anyone about it, I can’t complain.
 I just have to swallow the stress and slowly lose my hair.
 I can’t wake my daughter up at two o’clock in the morning and just sit on the end of her bed.
 “Hey, honey are you awake? Hey! You ever feel like you’re not going to make it? Do you ever feel like you just can’t do it anymore? Forget about it, get some sleep.
 I’ll see you at breakfast.”

 Yeah, not owning one, working in one.
 I don’t need that kind of pressure.
 Not a good beach, either.
 Jersey Shore in the winter.
 Yeah.
 This dream’s coming true.
 All I have to do is not wet myself in the interview.
 I’m getting this job.
 I want to make bagels for you in March at the Jersey Shore.
 “Did you just wet yourself?”
 “No, I did not.”
 “Welcome aboard.”
They say you should visualize your dreams.
 I do, I see it.
 I fantasize about it all the time.
 Who else works there? Juan, he’s 72.
 He makes the bagels.
 He rides his bike there.
 I throw in some Spanish, so he knows I’m cool.
 “Yo es muy guapo.”
 “You’re an idiot, Tom, but I like you.”
 And Sean, you need that guy.
 He’s a pothead, you need that.
 And Dolores, she works the register.
 A little older now, a little sloppy in the caboose… Doesn’t have a good dental plan, eats a lot of day-old bagels, but, you know… Beggars can’t be choosers.
 It’s Jersey Shore in the winter.

 I have a seventeen-year-old.
 She’s leaving.

 I didn’t want any of this.
 I didn’t want this house.
 I didn’t want this dog.
 I didn’t want to live in this town.
 I did this for you.

 No.

We have a mean girl.
 We have a mean girl.
 Yeah, I didn’t know they were real.
 They’re real.
 Yeah, I feel guilty.
 I made it.
 I feed it.
 I’m keeping it alive.
 I give it money.
 It’s like I’m funding the terrorists.
 But it is complicated, because I can’t tell how mean she is.
 When we were little, if you were a bad kid, they came right up to your father at school: “Hey, you got a shitty one here.
 And your father was grateful an adult was talking to him: “Thank you.
 I’ll beat him immediately.”
 Now, they’ll get fired if they say that.
 It’s confusing.
 I can’t tell how mean she is and I love her.
 So it’s all… I’m sure, at some point, Hitler’s parents must have turned to each other, like, “He’s a little weird, right?”
 “Yeah, he’s weird.
 He’s six.
 Who has a mustache like that at six?”
She got in the car the other day, reached over my shoulder, changed the radio station… A whole Taylor Swift station came on.
 I went to change it… All the stations are hers now.
 I’m like, “When did that happen?”
 She goes, “Don’t worry about it.
 Just make it louder.”
 Could you imagine, as a child, getting in your father’s car, demanding he put on your music and then, “Louder, a little lower, louder… Right there, chief, right there.”
 When you eventually came out of your coma… they would have told you a story of how arrogant you were… and why you lost five years of your life… when you were hit in the head with a pipe… that you deserve.
But I get it.
 You know, this is the age when music hits your life.
 You don’t listen to your parents anymore.
 When I was her age, that’s when Prince showed up.
 You think I was listening to my father? My fat, bald, white father… when Prince showed up? Right? Half naked, his little nipple hairs sticking out… Full mustache, but wearing makeup.
 Kind of gay, but singing about sleeping with women.

 To be honest, this cat and I did not get along.
 Uh, I tried to like her, but she didn’t like me.
 You know a cat doesn’t like you when you come home at night, it gets on its hind legs like a human being and runs at you with its claws out.
That’s alright.
 It’s not my job to love the animals.
 They want animals.
 It’s my job as the father to get them animals.
 I get them animals.
 I drive them home, they live with them and love them, and when they’re about to die, I drive them back out.
 I’m like the warden on death row.
 They hear me coming with the cat carrier, they all back into the room: “Who’s he coming for this time?”
 “I don’t know.
 Grace has been walking kind of funny.”
 There’s one old cat with a harmonica.
 “Don’t pay him no mind.
 He comes for all of us one day.”

So, I brought her in to the vet.
 She knows she’s not feeling well.
 And she knows it’s her last trip there.
 She sees the vet, turns to see my wife… I’m sitting there.
 The look of disappointment in this cat’s face like, “Really? You?”
 “Look, I don’t want to be here either.
 Let’s just get through this.”
 The vet’s like, “Alright, so this is what happens.
 We give them one shot, that mellows them out, then we give them the second shot.
 Does the trick.”
 I’m like, “I know.
 I’ve been here before.”
 And he said, “Okay.
 I’ll leave you two alone now, so you can say your goodbyes.”
 You’re in a vet’s office.
 You can’t be like, “No, I’m good.”
 “I can skip that part.
 Just give me that collar, I’ll get out of here.
 Oh, the goodbye.
 Right!”
 The cat’s like, “Get off of me.”
I didn’t think I was going to cry.
 I didn’t think I was going to cry, but… she was really working it.
 She was really working it.
 I felt like her last goal on Earth was to break me.
 You know? She just kept looking at me with those big eyes, just… And I was hanging in there.
 Then she went into her final purr.

 Right? Eat the right things when you can, walk the dog the long way, touch your toes once in a while… You don’t want to wake in the middle of the night sweating for no reason… trying to figure out which is the bad arm to be tingly.
 “Do we have baby aspirin? I think we’re supposed to take baby aspirin… or lick a baby? Does someone have a baby? I think I’m having a heart attack.”
 You’ve got to go for physicals once in a while, which isn’t the best.
 I just went recently.
 My doctor… So humiliating, isn’t it? At least when you go to an eye doctor, you’re like, “My eyes are good or bad.
 It’s not me.”
 But the doctor, it’s like, “You’ve been living like an animal.”
 “I’m sorry.
 I had a rough year.”
 So humiliating.
As a man, the most humiliating part… you’ve got to take your pants off in front of this guy.
 And I know, ladies, I know… what you deal with at the doctor’s office is much worse than us.
 I’m not comparing it.
 What you have to smoosh your boobs up against… I know.
 What you deal with… Look, there’s no stirrups where we go.
 There probably was at one time and we enjoyed it too much.
 But for us, the worst part… you pull your pants off, he cups your balls and makes you cough.
 Still.
 No one knows why.
 Just for fun.
 And then, I immediately turn around and assume the position… and get ready for the rear entry.
 And this doctor I’ve been going to for ten years goes, “No, I’m not doing that anymore.”
 “Well, it’s not like I wanted you to.”
 It’s like he was breaking up with me.
 I was like, “Hey, I only did this for you.”
----Punchline----
 “All these times… I didn’t enjoy it once.”

But you do what you can.
 I don’t want you to die.
 I want you to keep going, keep doing great.
 And don’t do what other people tell you is a good time.
 It never is, never is.
 Right? Breakfast in bed.
 Perfect example.
 Horrible idea.
 It’s a bad idea.
 Every poor mother on Mother’s Day has got to get a tray filled with hard toast and runny eggs… and we pin her down in her bed.
 “Enjoy your breakfast, like a hospital patient.
 Good luck not spilling the juice on your nightgown.
 We’ll be at IHOP.
 See you in an hour.”
And no more cruises.
 Stop with the dumbass cruises.
 It’s a dumb idea of a good vacation.
 Anything you can do on those dumbass boats, you can do here on land.
 Waterslide, shitty magic shows… It’s all here.
 You don’t need to go to the middle of the ocean, where you do not belong… with two thousand other people, floating around on a giant white toilet.
 That’s all those boats are: horrible toilets ruining the seas.
 What does everybody talk about on those dumb boats? “Oh! The food! Oh, my God.
 Seven meals a day.
 They take your three meals, they add four more to it.”
 Yeah, great, and what does everybody do? Waddle off to their room and take a dump in the sea.
 Stop it.
I was in Italy, in this tiny little town… You couldn’t fit one more person there.
 Scariest thing I ever saw.
 In the middle of dinner, this cruise ship pulled into port.
 It was like our city was being attacked… by a bigger city.
 The gangplank came down.
 They came waddling out in their Tommy Bahama and their flip-flops, ate everything they could find, went back on the boat, took another dump in the sea.
 Stop it.
[whooping]
And while we’re at it, no more zip lining.
 Stop with the goddamn zip lining in beautiful places.
 Isn’t it enough to go to these beautiful destinations, and absorb the beauty that’s before you in the three days you have there? Do you really have to be tied into a dirty harness and a lice-ridden helmet, pushed by a non-regulated local off a platform? Why? So you can fly along a wire through the treetops of the jungle? Get a book, sit at the ocean’s edge, and calm down.
 Look, you want to zip line through a scary place? I get it.
 You want to zip line through Staten Island? You should.
 You should be high above that place, moving quickly… trying not to get shot as fast.
And don’t watch so much news.
 Don’t watch so much news.

 But we’re also the first human brains that have to deal with horrible news, 24 hours a day on multiple devices.
 No other human being has had to deal with this onslaught.
 And it’s controlling us and it’s splitting us apart, and it’s turning us on each other.

Enjoy your day.”
 And you did, because that’s all the news you really need.
 That’s it.
 Don’t buy it.
 You’ve got to think for yourself.
 You guys, I’m telling you, you’ll live a much better life.
But really, the real thing, the real thing… honestly and with all sincerity, you have to find someone to love.
 You need someone to love.
 That’s the whole answer.
 Really.
 It doesn’t even have to be a person.
 It could be an animal.
 Really! You just need two eyes looking at you across the living room.
 It could be a fish! It could be a fish.
 Just looking at you, one eye at a time.
 Makes you feel accounted for, makes you feel needed.
 It’s important.
 You know?The hardest part is finding someone to trust.
 That’s hard.
 Because everyone lies to you.
 Everyone lies to you all the time.
 Your friends, co-workers, relatives, your parents… Your parents looked you in your little baby face and lied to you.
 I know they lied to you, because I have children and I lie to them.
I remember realizing my mother was a liar.
 She put out clothes for me, a new outfit for Tommy.
 You should have seen this outfit.
 For school, six years old, horrible.
 Red long-sleeved turtleneck shirt.
 Red! Long sleeved, form-fitting on my chubby body, turtleneck shirt.
 Tucked into orange plaid pants.
[groaning]
Yeah, with a belt and a buckle.
 So it was tucked in and cinched up tight.
 So, my little chubs hung over the side.
 And the pants didn’t go all the way down, so you saw my shoes, my hard, black, feminine dress shoes… with heels and buckles on those, like a pilgrim, like a fat little pilgrim.
I came down into the kitchen, “Are you sure, Mom? This is how I should go to school?”
 “Yes, you’re a handsome boy.”
 I went to school and got a beating… a beating… from children who cared.
 “Kick him again, someone’s lying to this fat bastard!”
 He thinks he looks good.
 He looks like he works the dog track at six years old.”
The hardest part, if you do find someone to love, and you’re trying to figure out if you’re going to go the distance, you have to realize, the person you’re dating isn’t the one you’re going to spend most of your years with.
 That’s why people split up.
 You have to think far out, 30 years out.
 What is this person going to be then? When you’re dating, that’s young and sexy.
 That’s the sales model.
 That’s what moves it off the showroom floor.
 You’ve got to think 30 years out.
 Picture your man now three times the size.
 Just a snowman of blubber around his existing body.
 And bald.
 He’s going to be bald, or worse, just three hairs.
 Like a doll that’s been caught in a fire.
No more cool clothes, comfortable clothes.
 Yeah.
 Elastic waistbands and terry cloth material.
 Yeah, and Crocs for adults… Yeah, that he wears with socks, because sometimes it’s cold in the morning when you’re getting the paper.
No more motorcycle in the garage, but he’s in the garage.
 You know why? He paints birdhouses now.
 Yeah, that’s why he’s not having sex with you.
 He’s painting birdhouses.
The same thing with your girl.
 Young, beautiful, long hair… When she’s old, it gets cut short, it goes straight up in a poof.
 Like she’s surprised.
 All old ladies look surprised.
 “Surprise! I’m still here.
 I almost slipped, but I didn’t.”
All she remembers about fashion is she likes flowers.
 That’s all she wears, a shower curtain dress filled with flowers.
 One on each toe, one on her surprise head.
 “Who wants to play cards?”
No more lace bras and panties.
 Underpants! Industrial-strength cotton, get-the-job-done, keep-everything-in-places-where-it-used-to-be underpants… that she hand washes in the sink.
 When you’re brushing your teeth and have to spit in the toilet, if you’re not aggravated, you married the right lady.
 And this isn’t a sad story, this is the story.

 You can find one.
 You can find one person who doesn’t make you throw up when they take their top off.
 What? Everyone’s weird and gross out there? Yeah? So are you! We all are.
 That’s what love is, my friends.
 Finding someone whose flaws you can put up with.
 That’s it.
 That’s chemistry.
You ever take the first morning flight? That 6:00 a.
m.
 flight… where you wake up at home at 4:00.
 You don’t even know how you got to the airport.
 You’re just, all of a sudden, under fluorescent lights at Security.
 [groans in confusion]
 You’re not in control of your body, no one is.
 I love that moment.
 Because there’s a sea of people who you could have woken up with, if you had made the wrong choice.
I was in on one recently, behind this older gentleman, he burped, farted and sneezed… at the same time.
 Just exploded out of every one of his openings, all at once.
 Pa-pow! Like a human tugboat.
 Pa-pow! It was horrible.
 People scattered.
 Changed lanes, changed flights… Went home and tried again tomorrow.
 His wife stood next to him, did not flinch.
 She probably does the same thing.
 The two of them, every morning firing off, making coffee… Pa-pow, pa-pow! The cat, the dog… Pa-pow, pa-pow-pow-pow! Like the grand finale on the 4th of July.
But that’s love and that’s what I wish for all of you.

 Uh, no grown-ups left, that’s kind of scary.
 There’s no one left to fight the bad guys.
 There’s adult coloring books now.
 Adult coloring books.
 And they’re popular.
 I saw a man–a man– a grown man– on the floor of an airport.
 A man laying on his stomach on the floor of an airport, just coloring, just– Why even wear pants? Why? You’re not a man.
 You’re a baby man.
 My friend’s like, “No, Tom, you don’t understand.
 “They are adult.
 I have one.
 It’s a ‘Game of Thrones’ coloring book.”
 My apologies.
 I thought it was something childish, like “The Hobbit.”
 I didn’t know it was “Game of Thrones.”
 That must be hard, with all the snow in that show.
 Having to use the white crayon? You never really know if it’s working or not.
 No one can deal.
 How about these people with the fake service dogs? You see these creeps? Fake service– there’s real service dogs that help real people.
 Then a girl shows up with a Pekinese sticking out of a Hello Kitty handbag and acts like it’s working.
 And how little do you have to think of yourself to scam a certificate and show it at the gate? “I have to have this puppy with me on this flight, or I’m gonna lose my marbles.”
 “Oh, by all means.
 Welcome aboard.”
 What could possibly go wrong with your crazy ass… at 40,000 feet? I got on a flight the end of last year.
 There was a woman next to me.
 I’m not making any of this up.
 Middle seat.
 She turned to me, and she had a Chihuahua in a BabyBjorn.
 I swear to–head, penis, legs, and dog arms.

 I live in a horrible school district in L.
A.

 And they have no skills or coordination, so I’m paying for school.
 Goes against everything I believe in, but I’m paying for school.
 My only rule for paying for school is, I won’t pay for any school that is predominantly Asian.
 Why? Why would I pay all of that money for my kids to be last in everything? We can’t compete.
 These families are dominant.
 They kick ass.
 We can’t compete.
 They’re straight-A students.
 These kids play five instruments, five.
 They’re walking to school.

 You need a bowl.
 You just pick it out of the other bowls.
 Congratulations, bowl.
 You’ve been nominated.
 Say good-bye to your friends.
 You’re the fruit bowl.
 And fruit isn’t even the main thing in the fruit bowl.
 It’s mostly car keys and pennies and garlic skin.
 One black banana from 1995.
 No one wants to pick it up, ’cause you know it’s gonna split.
 So if you have a lot of money and you help people, that’s one thing, but the culture’s devolved into this “I’m better than you” attitude just to have stuff.
 You know people in your family and friends who just mortgage it, lease it just to say, “I’m better than you,” even if they don’t have it.

 I don’t care.

 My grandmother never made it.

 I have to pay for everything, ’cause they have no money or skills of any kind.
 But for years, I would have to carry everything that they owned, like a mule, like a human mule.
 They would literally load everything on my back and then sit on top of the pile like a small Peruvian lady, and I would just walk through the airport with canteens hitting my legs, just standing at the gate with flies in my eyes.

 They call it “the happiest place on Earth.”
 For who? For who? Ugh! Look, I love the idea.
 I love the idea that this man created something out of his own head.
 He just wanted to create a nice little place where families can go and kids can let their imagination run wild and feel safe for a couple hours in this horrible world.
 Beautiful idea.
 But what he couldn’t foresee when he was developing it in 1950 was the type of people it was going to attract in 2016 in the United States of America, ’cause they didn’t make these kind of people back then.
 There weren’t dinosaur-sized people stomping through the park with their elephant children attached to their tail… Pushing the biggest strollers I’ve ever seen.
 I had no idea John Deere made strollers.
 One woman had five kids in it.
 Fi–I never–I don’t know what you even call that.
 A pentalometer? A jumbotron? Five pumpkin-faced kids eating cheeseburgers, and she’s plowing through the crowd, knocking other families out of the way like tumbleweeds just so she can get to the churro stand first.
 Then there are people there, women, who have no children at all, who want to be a princess themselves.
 Grown women who want to be a princess.
 They want to dress like Cinderella, but they don’t make a Cinderella dress for someone 48 years old, 6’5″, 380.
 They never had a meeting and said, “Let’s make more of those.”
 Does that stop them? No, it does not.
 They buy that dress.
 They stuff everything they have into it, and a lot doesn’t fit.
 There’s a lot of extra hanging over the sides.
 But that’s okay.
 They’re happy there.
 They have their autograph book and their wand, and they skip through the park.
 Fine.
 Honestly, I didn’t think I was gonna fall for it.
 I didn’t.
 I didn’t think we were gonna do.
 I didn’t.
 But once you make your own people, the ads just find you.
 Every time you open your phone, open your laptop, turn on TV, there they are, just selling you joy and perfection, right? Every time you turn it on, the mom and dad are beautiful, perfect teeth and hair, clothes.
 “I love you.”
 “No, I love you.”
 “You’re beautiful.”
 “No, you’re beautiful.”
 “Our kids are beautiful.”
 And the kids are holding Mickey’s hand, looking back at the parents.
 “Thanks, Mom and Dad, for not being stupid and poor.”
 I’ll admit it; I wanted to be that family.
 I wanted to be that family.
 We were not that family.
 We didn’t come close.
 We were not perfect.
 We were sweaty and pissed off and cursing in front of the children.
 “This is your damn fault.
 “If your parents didn’t raise you like an animal, we would have left a little bit earlier.”
 And the kids don’t even hear us, ’cause they’re slapping each other in the face.
 And we haven’t even parked yet.
 We haven’t even parked.
 We’re still in the van.
 We’re pissed off ’cause we didn’t get to park in Mickey and Minnie parking.
 They sent us with that big hand to the ass end of Chip and Dale parking.
 That’s another tram ride we didn’t plan for.
 Then you get to the front of the park.
 I know it’s a cliché, but you get up there.
 You open your wallet.
 They take everything you got.
 Everything– every dollar, every coin, every credit card, gym memberships, pictures of your family, unused condoms.
 That mouse rapes you at the turnstile, and you have to plaster a smile on your face in front of your kids, ’cause you don’t want to ruin the happiest place on Earth.
 “It’s gonna be a great… day, guys.
 It’s really gonna be a lot of fun.”
 Then you get inside.
 It’s just line after line after line.
 I thought I was gonna beat it.
 I had the app on my phone.
 I’m like, “I’m gonna beat ’em.”
 No, you’re not beating Disney.
 I’m like, “Let’s go on the Peter Pan ride.
 “That’s a horrible ride from 1912.
 “Look, no one wants to even go on it.
 The line only goes back and forth two times.”
 Yeah, up here.
 Then they take you to the basement.
 It loops around for three days.
 Then they shoot you out the ass end.
 It goes around the Matterhorn 12 times.
 And it’s a bad ride.
 It’s a bad ride.
 Old cardboard cutouts, Christmas lights that don’t even work anymore.
 All the voices are jumbled.
 [distorted]
 “I’m Tinker Bell.
 I’m Tinker Bell.”
 2 1/2 hours! Was it worth it? No.
 What would be worth it? Nothing.
 I get to the end of that line, there could be naked supermodels with bags of money and all-you-can-eat nachos.
 I’d be like, “No, not into it.
----Punchline----
 You lied to me.”

 Here’s what I learned, though.
 Here’s what I learned.
 If you go ahead and go–and if you make your own people, you’re gonna have to go– you just want to go once.
 You want to go once, so you got to blow it out, make it all about the kids, go big.
 Give ’em your money.
 “Here’s $300 cash, kids.
 “Spend it the way you want to spend it.
 It’s your day.”
 And halfway up Main Street, they’ll be broke, ’cause they’re small, and they’re stupid and gullible.
 And they’re going to buy a lot of blinking stuff that’s not gonna work by the time they get outside.
 And now they’re laying in the gutter of Main Street like little Disney hobos, broken toys, crying, just yelling at the characters.
 “Get over here, duck, and shake your ass.
 I got nothing left.”
 Make sure you fill them with sugar, a lot of sugar.
 Make them tweak out on sugar.
 Don’t even have to wear sunblock.
 “How about that, kids? “You hate when I put it on you.
 “I don’t want to put it on you.
 “Don’t wear it.
 I bet you don’t even burn in Disney.”
 They do burn, especially when they’re little.
 They turn purple, and they start to blister.
 And now they’re crying.
 They got broken toys.
 They’re crashing on sugar.
 And this is when you walk ’em.
 You got to walk the hell out of ’em.
 Give ’em the map.
 “Anywhere you want to go.”
 “Oh, you want to go from the Cars ride “to It’s a Small World? “Sure, 20 miles apart.
 Let’s start walking.”
 Midnight rolls around.
 They’ve been on two rides the whole day.
 We’ll never go back again.

   I like moving around, especially by myself.
 You get to see a lot of people, and it’s inspirational.
 You know, people are good, and they’re kind, and they look out for each other.
 And–yeah, I actually like people more the older I get.
 When I was younger, I didn’t like people so much, and now, you know, you realize, “We’re all the same, you know?”
 You pee on your own leg more than three times a week.
 You’re like, “How great am I?”
 You know? And that’s another thing I don’t understand about the wealth.
 I mean, what’s the thing? What’s the goal? To just get so much money, you isolate yourself from everybody else? Just go from your helicopter to your island and back to your place? Why? We’re only here once.
 You got to mix it up, you know? Look, I’m not Pollyannaish about it.
 I mean, sometimes I get around people in a crowd, I wish I had my own helicopter.
 Not just to fly away.

Sometimes.
 But for the most part, people are cool, and they look out for each other, and it’s nice, you know? And the only bad part: it only takes one person who doesn’t know how to act among us to ruin the good time of everyone else, some disgusting behavior, and it ruins the good time of everybody, ’cause they’re breaking the human contract, which is very simple.
 You’re abiding by it right now.
 So when we get around each other, just turn it down a notch.
 Don’t do publicly what you like to do privately.
 When you’re alone, it gets kind of weird.
 That’s okay.
 You’re an animal.
 There’s only so long you can not put a finger in one of your openings.
 That’s okay.
 Hey, you got a job to do.
 They don’t make tools for everything you got to get done.
 Fine.
 Right now, there’s someone in here that likes filling up his pants with Cheez Doodles and dancing around like a pretty pony.
 And he’s not doing it.
 He’s fighting the urge until he gets home.
 And we respect you for that, sir.
 We thank you.
 And I guarantee you it’s a sir.
 I guarantee you.
 These other people don’t care.
 They think the whole world centers around them, disgusting people.
 They just walk around peeing on things, farting everywhere, letting their dogs go all over your lawn, blowing their nose in the air.
 Have you ever been around that guy? What the hell? What is– what goes on in your head where you think, “I’ve got something in my nose” and the other part of your brain says, “Blow it out of your face now”? And they’re good at it, which means they practice.
 Awful people, disgusting people, the same people that curse in front of children, don’t give up their seat for old people, don’t hold the door open for women– awful people.
 They’re the same people that bring their own smelly-ass food on planes.
 They apparently think they’re flying alone, and they bring this smelly-ass food that they made in a disgusting laboratory they call a kitchen.
 Awful.
 You know who these people are, by the way, ’cause they’re the ones walking through the airport carrying their own pillow from their bed.
 That’s a psychopath.
 If you’re a grown-up and you take your pillow out of your bedroom, you better stop at the couch, and you better have the flu.
 You open the door and take it out into the world with you, you should be caught with a net, and we should never see you again.
 “Going on a big trip today.
 “What’s that? You’re so right, pillow.
 You’re so right.”
 Look, I don’t think there should be food on a plane at all.
 How about that, chubsy? How about that? Can you survive without a sandwich? Can you do it? During the Great Depression, we ate nothing but rusty nails and dirt for years.
 Can you make it to Boise without a sandwich? All right, maybe I’m insensitive.
 Maybe you have a tapeworm that needs feeding.
 I don’t know.
 I don’t know what’s going on inside your gut.
 But then be nice, something non-offensive.
 How about an apple, maybe some trail mix? The last flight I was on, a guy broke out a tuna fish and dead skunk ass sandwich.
 I don’t know what part of Whole Foods has that, but this guy found it, chopped it up with tuna and mayo, and put it on rye.
 And he waited till the doors were shut and we’re at 10,000 feet.
 He released this stink bomb like it was a planned attack.
 You ever smell something so bad that you just get confused? Your head snaps back.
 You make little circles with your hands.
 You just blurt something out.
 “Roosevelt!”
 [panting]
 “Just keep breathing out.
 Just breathe out, out.”
 “It’s too late.
 I breathed in.
 It’s in me.
 I breathed in.
 I messed up.
 It’s in me.
 I can taste it.
 I can taste it.”
 People were opening their air vents just to get air from somewhere else.
 “Oh! Oh! I don’t care if it’s from the engine.
 Oh!”
 People were putting their faces in strangers’ armpits for relief.
 You know what kills me about these situations? All the good people, the social tension of all the nice, cool people.
 How many other people on the flight? 200? 300 people? So nice, so kind.
 They don’t even complain.
 They just sit there and suffer in silence.
 You’ve never been in that situation and have a guy pop up at the back.
 “Are you kidding me? “No, honey, let me go.
 This has to be said.
 “7:00 in the morning, skunk ass.
 “Screw you! Oh, I’m the bad guy.

Never.
 The most you get, people just roll their eyes and whisper.
 “Pee-yew, he smells.
 I think it’s skunk ass.
 I would never do that.
 That’s terrible.”
 I’ve got two people that I made.
 I’ve got two kids.
 And they’re going through a weird phase.
 I don’t know if it’s a weird phase.
 It’s just–my kids are finally realizing I’m not as great as they thought.
 You know what I mean? Like, for years, I was their god.
 They were amazed by everything I did.
 “He gets food.
 I don’t know how he does it.”
 “That’s nothing; I saw him lift a chair over his head by himself.”
 “Wow!”
 “I know!”
 The other day, I was yelling at ’em.
 I mixed up their names.
 They shot me a look like, “Oh.
 Maybe our leader’s an idiot.
 Maybe he’s not kidding when he says he can’t help with our math homework.”
 And they’re not wrong.
 I can’t help them anymore.
 I don’t understand it.
 But I have to act like it’s a parenting decision for my own ego.
 They’ll be like, “Dad, can you help me with my math homework?”
 “No, I’m not giving you the answers.
 This is between you and your teacher.
 Work it out.”
 Then I’m in the bathroom on YouTube, “How do you add fractions with different bottoms? “Oh, you just got to make them the same.”

 A Katy Perry station comes on.

 She’s like, “Don’t worry about it.
 Just make it louder.”
 Could you imagine? I couldn’t imagine, as a child, getting in my father’s car, demanding my music, and then, “Louder.
 Lower.
 A little louder.
 Right there, Chief.

 We fight for equality, and we push strollers.

 Because inside all of us is a 16h-century man who wants to burn the village to the ground.
 He’s always in there, so just keep that in mind.
 If you have a man, you have a wild animal.
 This is a wild animal, so use him wisely.
 You’re in control, so don’t do stupid things with your man.
 Don’t ask us to do certain things.
 Don’t be stupid.
 Don’t ask us to watch the children.
 What are you doing? We’re not really watching the children, not the way you watch the children.
 We watch them eat bottle caps and fall down stairs.
 And we laugh.
 Don’t ask me to shop with my 13-year-old.
 I shouldn’t be shopping for clothes.
 I shouldn’t be in Forever 21, waiting for my daughter to come out of the dressing room.
 No one there knows I have a daughter in the dressing room.
 They just see a sweaty, uncomfortable man breathing heavy by himself next to the bras and panties.
 And I shouldn’t pick the young one up from gymnastics.
 No dad should be picking up his daughter from gymnastics.
 I shouldn’t be hanging out with the other moms, waiting for it to be over.
 They’re all talking about juice boxes and play dates.
 All I’m thinking is, “Which one of these moms would I have sex with first?”
 I’m being honest.
 That’s where our head goes.
 Not which one would I have sex with, by the way, ’cause I’d have sex with all of them.
 The weird one, the one with the thing on her eye, I’ll make it work.
 I can make it work.
 But which one first, while I’ve got the energy? That’s my job, try and give them lessons, but it’s hard, because the real world starts coming in, right? And they start learning about the real world.
 I try to protect them, but they start learning about all the good and the bad that’s out in the world, and it’s funny in my house, ’cause they’re learning about it at different rates.
 You know, like, we learned about Thanksgiving, and the little one’s like, “Oh, we love Thanksgiving.
 “We love the Indians.
 We gave them our buckle hats and our shoes and a turkey, and they gave us some feathers and some mashed potatoes, and we had dinner with them, and they love us, and we love them.”
 And the 13-year-old’s just leaning against the refrigerator.
 “What’s this Trail of Tears I’m hearing about? We took their land and then moved them out west, then took their land again and then killed them all?”
 And the little one’s like, “It’s not the same Indians, right, Dad?”
 I’m like, “Yeah, it’s the same Indians.”
 She’s like, “Why did we do that?”
 “Oh, easy with the ‘we,’ first of all.

 We’re Italian.
 We got here in 1945.

It’s a crazy house.
 16 years putting this whole thing together, and it works.
 I wish you the same success.
 I really do.
 And the family is a good thing.
 16 years in the family, 16 years with the same woman, the same person.
----Punchline----
 Good thing.

 It’s good, and it works.
 But it’s time for a girlfriend.
 It’s definitely time for a girlfriend.
 It’s not fair.
 It’s not fair to my wife.
 It’s not fair to this woman to expect her to act like a girlfriend for this long; it’s not.
 Look, when you’re a girlfriend, you’re motivated.
 You’re excited to see that guy come home.
 My wife is not that good of an actress.

 This poor woman has watched me walk from the bedroom to the bathroom in the middle of the night, underwear hanging off my ass, banging into furniture in the dark, for 16 years.

I’m out of stories.
 I’ve run out of stories.
 You ever hang out with a married couple, the guy starts telling a story, the wife just starts stirring her drink and rolling her eyes? “Here we go again.
 Blah, blah, blah.
 We’ve all heard it, Don.
 We’ve all heard it.”
 We’re entering that stage.
 I’m a comedian.
 She doesn’t think I’m funny.
 It’s time for a girlfriend.
 And look, I’m not gonna be sneaky about it.
 I’m not gonna cheat.
 I’m gonna sit her down.
 I’m gonna tell her my plans straight out.
 I’ll be like, “Look, I found a girl.
 “She’s young, and she’s dumb.
 She’s just what we need.
 She hasn’t heard any of my stories.
 She thinks I’m hilarious.
 She wants to fool around all the time.
 Don’t think of her as my girlfriend.
 Think of her as your assistant.”
Thank you so much, Cleveland.
 You guys were wonderful.

 Thank you so much.
