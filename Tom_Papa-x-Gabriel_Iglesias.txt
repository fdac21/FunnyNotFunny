 He looks at my son, “Is this the infamous Frankie?”

 Just go online and fill out the application.
 Once it’s registered, call me personally and I’ll see to it that you get an interview.
 The only position we have available right now is for a host, but there’s plenty of room for opportunity here at Red Lobster.

I’m in the middle of trying to deal with this whole situation with my son watching these videos and not going to work, and while I’m doing this, I get the most random phone call I’ve ever gotten.
 My publicist calls me up and she’s like, “Gabe! Snoop Dogg is looking for you.”
 -“Excuse me?”
 -“Snoop Dogg, you know–” “I know who Snoop Dogg is! What do you mean, he’s looking for me?”
 “Well, he’s looking–” “Is he looking for me or is he looking for me?”
 “He’s a fan and he wants to interview you.”
 “Oh, cool! Sounds good.
 What is it?”
 “I think it’s some type of podcast.”
 “I’m in.
 Can I bring Frankie?”
 “Absolutely.”
 “Cool.”
 So I hang up the phone.
 I’m excited.
 I want to tell my son.
----Punchline----
 I’m like, “Frankie! I’m walking towards your room.”

 We get in the car.

 And now we’re off on this adventure to go do an interview with Snoop Dogg.
 You guys, let me tell you something.
 We get to the neighborhood and we’re lost.
 The GPS says we’re there, but we’re lost.
 We’re looking for a house, and there’s no house, just a big building.
 And so I’m like, “This doesn’t look– A podcast? Really?”
 So I pull up to the security gate.
 [mimics engine, tires screeching]
 Tap the button on the wall.
 [beep, line trilling]
 “Security desk.
 Can I help you?”
 Hey, Security Desk.
 My name is Gabriel Iglesias.
 I think I’m here to do an interview with Snoop Dogg.
 “Okay, one moment.”
 Oh, okay, this is it.
 Good, good.

 Snoop just starts talking and at some point, they hit “Record.”

 I says, “You know what, I got this far.
 I’m going to push it.
 I want to meet him.”
 I’ve always wanted to meet Chris Rock.
 It was not hard.
 Once I was back there, I just had to go to the dressing rooms.
 All I had to do was read the name on the door.
 I’m standing there, in front of the door, and I’m hyperventilating.
 [panting]
 [mimics knocking]
 The door opens up and there’s this man in there, this bodyguard who’s just massive.
 I’m a big guy, but damn, he was huge! As soon as he opened the door… 
[low-pitched growl]
 [mimics whooshing]
 [roaring]
 For real.
 Welcome to Jurassic– Big! Grandote.
 And I’m standing there and I’m like… “Hi.”
 And he’s like, “Can I help you?”
 “Yes, my name is Gabriel, I’m a comedian.
 And I wanted to see if I could say hi to Chris Rock if that’s possible.”
 “You say you comedian?”
 “Yes.”
 “Well, then you understand Chris is going over his material right now.
 He really ain’t trying to talk to nobody.
 So I’ll tell you what, player, if you want to come by after the show, You’re more than welcome to, but right now it’s not a good time.
 Chris Rock is a busy man.”

 Chris Rock called me the king of the Mexicans.
 For the rest of the show, everyone referred to me as “El Chapo.”
 I was celebrating the fact that I got away with that for so long.
 For so long! “I snuck backstage at Chris Rock! I snuck backstage, I snuck–“Until Karma showed up one day, in the form of the most extreme fan I have ever had in 20 years of me being a comedian.
 I had someone who not only made it backstage.
 This person paid to get into my dressing room.
 Okay? Yeah.
 He didn’t pay me, by the way.
 He didn’t pay me.
 I’m an honest hoe.
 Okay? I made no money that day, alright? If I had gotten paid, you wouldn’t be hearing this story.
 Here’s the thing.
 I walk into my dressing room from the bathroom.
 I just finished showering up and I’m in a towel.
 I walk into the room, come to find out later that this man was a very wealthy businessman in the community, okay? And when I walked into the room, he’s wearing a very, very nice suit.
 So when I saw the suit, I didn’t give it a second thought, because he looked professional.
 I thought maybe he was the general manager of the building, one of the concert promoters, he could have been someone’s agent… So when I walked in the room, in my towel, right, “Can I help you?”
 He looks at me and it was the most uncomfortable conversation I have ever had.
 He looks at me and says, “Listen.

The point to this story is just because you have a difference in opinion, it doesn’t mean that you can’t have respect for one another, you can’t have love for one another, that you can’t have incredible friendships with one another.
 It’s our differences that make us special.
 What a lot of us need to work on is our delivery.
 It’s all in the way you say things.
 That’s why text messages are always misinterpreted.
 ‘Cause you read the text according to how you feel.
 “What does he mean, ‘Hello’?”
 Yeah.
 Anyway, Dave has gotten us to 48 of the 50 states.
 He doesn’t travel with us outside of America.
 He prefers it that way.
 Last year, we got a chance to do a European tour of 15 countries.
 Estonia, Germany, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, UK… We’re just bouncing around all over the place.
 And then we wound up on the other side of the world.


Out of all the countries I performed in, my favorite country outside of home is Australia.
 And I’ll tell you why.
 Australia, much like us in America, has its list of priorities.
 You know what’s not on their list? Political correctness.
 They do not care about your feelings.
----Punchline----
 It’s like a country full of Daves.

 And if you know that before you go there, you’re going to have an amazing time, but if you don’t know that and you show up, it is a culture shock and a half, because I showed up and I didn’t know.

 Sydney, Australia, at the Opera House, for me, was one of the most iconic places I’ve ever got to perform in and it was bucket list, definitely.

 I’m hanging out at a pub.

 Actually, I’ve had some pretty awesome times over the last 20 years.
 And whenever I talk to fans, they have certain questions about my past, whether it’s my family, my upbringing, where my mom came from, where my dad came from… Certain stories.
 I love the fact that I had someone ask me one time, “In your 20-plus years as a comedian, what has been your greatest moment?”
 My greatest moment wasn’t even something that happened at a show, but it was because of what I was able to do for someone very special to me.
 My mom, who is no longer with us, she meant everything to me.
 She was my biggest supporter, even though she would never laugh at my jokes.
 She would get mad at her friends that wouldn’t laugh.

 So a few years ago, Vicente Fernandez and myself were both performing at the same venue, a venue called the Gibson Amphitheatre in Los Angeles.
 It is no longer there.
 A woman by the name of Emily was running the building.
 I was there the week before Vicente Fernandez, and after three sold-out shows she comes up to me and says, “Gabriel, thank you so much for this incredible business.
 We’re so happy with how the shows turned out.
 I have a question for you.
 Is your mom a fan of Vicente Fernandez?”

 “I thought so.
 Listen, Vicente Fernandez is going to be performing here next week.
 And I wanted to do something very special for you to show my appreciation.
 Do you think you and your mom would like to come see him perform and I’ll get you front-row center?”
 I said, “Emily, that sounds amazing.
 I’m pretty sure the answer is yes, but my mom is old school, so I still got to ask.
 I’ll call you.”
 So I get to my mom’s house, and I see her.
 “Mama.”
 “Dime, mi hijo.”
 Mi hijo in Spanish means “my son.”
 So my mom would always tell me that, my son, mi hijo.
 Mi hijo.
 “Dime, mi hijo.”
 “Tell me, my son.”
 I said, “Mom, would you like to go see Vicente Fernandez in concert?”
 And she looked at me and said, “Mi hijo, that sounds nice.”
 That’s exactly how she said it.
 She was very even-keeled.
 She wouldn’t show a lot of emotion.
 So I call Emily and I said my mom’s in.
 “Awesome.
 I’ll see you next week.”
 So we get to the venue and we’re early, so they have us in this little VIP section where they’re giving us free drinks and free snacks, and my mom was so cute.
 She walks up to me and she says, “Mi hijo, are the drinks free?”
 I said, “Mom, yeah, the drinks are free, but don’t worry about it.”
 “No, no, no, mi hijo, I didn’t bring any money.
 I don’t have no money.”

 So I got my mom arm in arm, and we’re walking down the hallway, okay? Come on, Mama.
 Let’s go.

 We’re walking down the hallway, and we’re getting closer and closer to Vicente Fernandez’s dressing room.
 The door is wide open, and I can hear a commotion coming out of the dressing room.

 And then a man and a woman exit the room and the man is holding on to the woman’s shoulders and he’s like, “It’s okay, it’s okay.
 It’s okay, it’s okay.”

 Okay? [wailing]

 Pasale in Spanish means “come on in.”

 My mom starts walking up to, Vicente.
 He was so nice.
 He goes out to shake my mom’s hand and my mom grabs his hand.
 And I don’t know where she got this strength and energy from, but she grabbed him and pulled him in.
 Hard, like the video game.
 “Get over here!”
 And then hooked him.
 She hooked him and she starts screaming into his chest.

 “I got something for you.”
 Oh, what’s that? And she hands me an envelope and I open it, and inside the envelope is the picture.
 She printed it out for me, and when I looked at it I got so choked up because I have never seen my mom so happy in a picture.

 There was a little guy behind me going, “Pikachu.”
 He was like, “Yo tambien soy Pokemon.”
 No.
 Uh-uh.
 But it was kind of crazy.
 I was getting checked out by guys.
 I was like, “Oh, my God.”
 And I know they were checking me out, ’cause they were looking at me like I look at tacos.
 But then I thought about it.
 “Oh, my God, I just turned on a man.
 Shoot.”
 Man, I called my girlfriend.
 I said, “You better not mess up.
 I have options.”
 Uh-huh.
 I have memory.
 A few years back, I was doing a show at the Comic Strip, and my idol, Mr.
 Paul Rodriguez, was in town doing a benefit.
 He calls up the Comic Strip, and he says, he says, “Hey, listen, I’m doing a benefit up the street.
 “Y sabes que, vato? “I’m gonna come down there, and I want to do some shots.
 Some tequila, some tacos.”
 I’m like, “Let’s do it.”
 He shows up to the club, and he says, “All right, get in the car.
 Let’s go.”
 “Where are we going?”
 “We’re going to Juarez.”
 “Juarez? Let’s eat some tacos here.”
 “I can’t afford you here.
 Let’s go to the other side.”
 [makes engine noise]
 So we wind up on the other side, and we wound up killing some tacos, and, you know, we wound up crossing the border.
 And when we crossed the border, it was a few months after I taped a bunch of water commercials here.
 You guys remember the water commercials? Yeah, and then they pulled me off the advertising because they said I was too fat to sell water.
 Whatever.
 So we’re crossing the border, and Immigration was right there, and they’re checking the cars, and we’re in a blue van.
 My buddy Jim, who’s sitting over there, was driving, and Border Patrol comes over to the window, and he goes— he opens the door and he sees me.
 He goes, “Oh, my God.
 It’s you.
 You’re hysterical.
 And I go, “What do you think of this guy?”
 And Paul was like, “Hey, what’s up?”
 And the guy was like, “Oh, my God.”
 So we wound up taking pictures at the border.
 And it was so funny, ’cause we’re outside the car, and we’re pretending to be arrested, right? People are driving by going, “Let Paul Rodriguez and Pikachu go!”
----Punchline----
 They’re American! Let ’em go!”

 So we go in there, and I’m like, “Oh, my God.”
 As soon as we walked in, I’m like— I’m thinking Paul’s gonna be all like, “Shh, I don’t want nobody to know I’m here.”
 Goes over to the DJ, and the DJ’s like, “All right, ladies, look who just walked in: Paul Rodriguez!”
 All of a sudden, there’s, like, 32 lap dances that stop like that.
 And all these girls, they bum-rush Paul.
 And I’m like, “Wow, I got to get funnier.”
 So we’re hanging out there for a couple of hours.
 So we wind up outside in the parking lot, And this girl jumped into the car, and she’s like, “Oh, my God, Paul Rodriguez.
 “I love you.
 My mama’s a huge fan too.
 Here.
 Please, please, please.”
 And he, “Whatever, whatever, okay, come here, come here.”
 “Here, please, talk to her on the phone.”

 He looks at me in the front seat, and he goes, “Hey, tu, Iglesias.

 Yeah, man, I love Paul.
 Like I said, Paul’s the… you know, one of the main reasons why I got into comedy.
 And he used to mess with me a lot; trust me.
 In my last special, I talked about how I had a Volkswagen Beetle.
 It was a true story.
 I really had a Beetle.
 And I got rid of it because I got tired of the fat jokes.
 When you’re a fluffy guy and you have a little car and all of your friends are professional comedians… oh, they’ll make you cry.
 Paul, especially.
 “How the hell did you manage to squeeze inside of that? “Hombre, I have never seen a car expand before “while someone was inside of it.
 “How do you get a stretch mark on the windshield? “That’s what I want to know.
 When you fart, does it go faster?”
 One after another after another.
 I’m like, “Oh, my God.”
 And you know what it is? It’s Karma.
 ‘Cause ten years ago, I did a joke about Paul Rodriguez on TV.
 I used to be on a show on the Nickelodeon Network called AII That.
 Some of you remember? Yeah? That was me, a lot smaller.
 I was only two X’s.
 I was a dos equis.
 Yeah.
 Anyway, as soon as the TV show season was over, they gave all the cast members gifts.
 They gave this one girl a TV, this one kid a DVD collection.
 Since I was the only one who had his own car, they gave me a car alarm with a remote start to it.
 A lot of cars have those now, but think back ten years ago.
 There was only a few that had the… 
[imitates alarm beeping, car engine starting]
 My friends went, “Where’d you get that?”
 I looked at them, and I said… “Nickelodeon!”
 “That’s bad!”
 I go to show it off to everybody.
 I show it to my mom, I said, “Mom, go to the car.
 I got to use the bathroom.
 I left you a present.”
 [gasps]
 “Un present, okay!”
 So she goes to the car, and I started the car from the kitchen.
 [imitates alarm beeping, car engine starting]
 ” El diablo! El diablo! El diablo!”
 I had to run outside.
 “Mom, it’s not the devil.
 Lookit, lookit, lookit.”

 “Nickelodeon!”
 “Oh, my God, mijo.
 Oh, my God, you scared me.”
 Me sacastes un pedo, mijo.
 “Oh, my God, mira.

 Smell, mijo, smell.
 ” I wind up doing a show in Hollywood at a comedy club, and I’m working with my idol, with Paul Rodriguez.
 Soon as the show was over, we go—you know, we’re walking out the door, and he walks up to me and he says, “You know, I like the whole fluffy thing you do.
 “It’s catchy.
 Sounds cute.
 Keep eating.”
 We walk outside, and my car is parked there first because I showed up late.
 So I’m—you know, my car’s right there and Paul walks by.
 “All right, take it easy.”
 He walks right in front of my car.
 And my friend goes, “Dude, show him your car.
 Show him Nickelodeon.”
 And I couldn’t help it, you know, freakin’… 
[imitates alarm beeping, car engine starting]
 “Hey! Hijole!”
 What the hell? What is this?”
 “Paul!”
 “Nickelodeon!”
 “Hombre, cabron pinche, Fluffy, you gave me a heart attack.

 Valet brings his car around, a brand-new Porsche 91 1.
 The car was nice.
 You know, it pulls up.

 Valet gives him the keys.
 He turns around and looks at me.

 Reason why I say “used to say” is because now there are six.

 But you still let the big guy ride your elevator.

 Level six, you see walking towards your elevator.

 Whatever.
 Other places I’ve had fun—IHOP.
 Look at some of you— “IHOP? ” Yeah, let me explain this one.
 Next time you go to an IHOP, look for the podium.
 Usually on the weekends, they’ll have the podium set up right at the front door, and when you walk in, they’ll have a host and they’ll ask you, “How many in your party?”
 And you tell them two, three, four, whatever the case, and then when it’s time for your seats, they’ll call you with the little freaking— you know, they got the microphone on the side of the wall, and they’ll go, “Paging party of four, paging party of four, now serving.”
 When that party walked away, I grabbed her microphone and I said, “Paging Mexican party of 47, Mexican party of 47, now serving.”
 And the whole restaurant was like… All the guys in the kitchen.
 ” Orale guey!”
 Hell, yeah.
 I love IHOP.
 I go too much, you guys.
 I was at an IHOP one time during an earthquake.
 Wasn’t a big one.
 It was enough to feel it, but not freak out, you know.
 I live in California, so we get ’em a lot.
 But if you’re not used to that, you’re all… 
[screaming]
 “Earthquake!”
 You know, and I’m sitting there.

 In December, I had five Christmas parties.
 I got a phone call from my agent.
 He’s like, “Gabe, check it out.
 “CHP, California Highway Patrol, wants to hire you to do a show.”
 I go, “Really? What does it pay?”
 “They want you to donate your time.”
 “I think I’m busy.”
 “They told me to let you know you have a warrant in the city of Fresno, California.”
 I’m like, “Oh, they’re good.”
 So I did the show.
 And I’m gonna tell you guys right now— I’m gonna tell you guys right now, it was one of the scariest shows I ever did.
 A room full of nothing but cops.
 Everybody’s drinking a lot.
 And I’m scared, because if they get ghetto, who do I call? You know, I got to go out in the parking lot and find some gang member.
 “Hey, back me up!”
 So the show went good.
 It went so good that they asked me to do another show in California, in San Diego, for the California Highway Patrol Border Division.
 And I tried to make up an excuse that my car wasn’t working right.
 They said, “No worries.
 We understand.”
 They sent a patrol car to my house with a freaking uniformed officer.
 And I was like, “Oh, my God.”
 Best part was I didn’t tell my family he was coming.
 Oh, yeah, sometimes you have to create your own entertainment.
 It was hysterical.
 5:00 rolled around.
 I’m like, “He should be here any minute.”
 Sure enough… 
[imitates doorbell ringing]
 “Frankie! Frankie, can you get the door, please?”
 “Okay, Gabriel.”
 So he goes to the door.
 Comes back, and he’s got, like—you know, he’s like… 
[whispering]
 “Gabriel.
 Gabriel, the police are here.”
 “Why are you whispering?”
 ‘”Cause something’s gonna happen.”
 When he said that, I’m like, “Oh, I got to freaking let him have it now, right?”
 I said, “Oh, my God, Frankie, they found me.”
 “What do you mean, Gabriel?”
 “I got to go, Frankie.
 I got to go.
 “Take care of your mom for me, okay? I love you.
 I love you.”
 “No!”
 “I got to go, Frankie.”
 And I saw the officer— I said, “Pretend you’re arresting me.
 I want to freak out my kid.”
 “No problem.
 Turn around and put your hands behind your back.”
 “I can’t reach.
 “Just hold my hand.
 “Walk me to the car.
 Just walk me to the car.
 “Come on, just walk me to the car.
 “He doesn’t know the difference, dude.
 “Just walk me to the freaking car.
 Come on.”
 I get to the cop car.
 He throws me in the backseat, right, and slams the door.
 And I ask him, “Is it okay if I yell out the window to freak out my kid?”
 “You want to use the microphone?”
 “Yeah!”
 Freaking… 
[imitates microphone feedback]
 “Here you go, sir.”
 And he hands me the microphone, and I said, “Frankie, this is the police.
 “We have your father.
 “We’re coming back for you in one hour.
 Do your homework.”
 [imitates siren warbling]
 [imitates car driving away]
 One minute later, my girlfriend calls me.
 “You’re an ass!”
 “What’s he doing?”
 “He’s doing his homework.”
----Punchline----
 “That’s called parenting, baby.”

 He got even with me, though.
 He totally got even with me.
 I walked in the kitchen one morning.
 He’s sitting there, and he looks at me, and he goes, “Gabriel, I have a question for you.
 What’s a hooker?”
 [sternly]
 “What did you say?”
 “What’s a hooker?”
 “Where did you hear that?”
 “I was watching HBO, and there was a commercial “for a show called Hookers at the Point.
 “It said, ‘This Saturday at 1 1:30, “check out all the hookers.
’ What’s that mean?”
 “That means we’re going out Saturday.”
 “What’s a hooker?”
 “Let it go, dude.”
 “Tell me.”
 “You don’t need to know.”
 “Tell me.”
 “Frankie, that’s for adults.”
 “You said I was an adult.”
 “I said you eat like an adult.
 “And what you do in the bathroom, “you are grown up— trust me— but you don’t need to know what a hooker is.”
 He throws a fit in the kitchen.
 “Hooker! Hooker! Hooker! Hooker!”
 “What are you doing?”
 “Hooker!”
 He won’t stop.
 I don’t know what to do, so I snapped.
 “Quit it!”
 And he stopped.
----Punchline----
 And apparently, his mom heard that.

 It’s, like, you live by the cake, you die by the cake, you know? No.
 Uh-uh.
 So we’re going back and forth, right? We wake up Frankie, and Frankie walks into the kitchen at 3:00 in the morning, and he’s, all… 
[mumbling]
 “Where did all the cake come from?”
 “The people at the show brought it.”
 “Tell ’em I said thank you.”
 “I’ll tell ’em you said thank you, Frankie.”
 “Gabriel, how come they bring you cake?”
 ‘”Cause ten years ago, I did a joke where I said, ‘”I love chocolate cake.
’ Now people bring me cake.”
----Punchline----
 “You should say you love Transformers.”

 “Want some cake?”
 “Yeah.”
 So I grab one of these tiny cakes that somebody brought me.
 One of those little tiny ones that has the plastic cover and the sticker on the side.
 And I handed to him.
 I go, “Here.”
 He goes, “A little piece?”
 I go, “Dude, it’s a small cake.
 You can have the whole thing.”

 He’s in the bathroom crying.

 “Hey, are you okay?”
 “Oh, my stomach!”
 “Your stomach? Too much cake?”
 “Yeah.”
 “Was it good?”
 “Hell, yeah.”
 “I’ll see you in the car.”

 I get him to school 45 minutes late.
 Usually, when I drop him off, you guys, I leave him on the side of the school, and they have, like, a drop-off zone with cones and a supervisor to make sure that your kid gets off safely.
 When you’re 45 minutes late, there’s nobody there, so I left him in front of the school.
 And apparently, that’s a no-no.
 You’re not supposed to do that.
 I didn’t know, you know? [engine purring, tires squeal]

 And I know it’s the principal, ’cause he’s, like, “It’s the principal! It’s the principal! It’s the principal! It’s the principal!”
 “Dude, relax.
 I’m 30.
 I don’t give a damn.”
 Here comes the principal.
 “Sir? Sir, this is not the designated drop-off area.

 We’re having a good time right now with his mom.
 And it sucks, you guys, ’cause we got into a fight that weekend.
 Eh… it was not too big, but it was, like, it was— it could have been prevented.
 My girlfriend’s backing the car up out of the driveway, and somebody had left, like, this— I guess they were moving, and they left this big box behind the car, and my girlfriend’s backing up, and I go, “Baby, baby, there’s a box.”

 I snuck it in there, huh? [sighs]
 No, no fighting.
 But I had to make up the fact that I yelled at Frankie.
 I go, “Frankie, whatever you want to do, let’s do it.”
 “Gabriel, can we go to an arcade?”
 “Arcade? Dude, you have a Nintendo Wii at your house.”
 And then I had a flashback to 20 years ago.
 [in shrill voice]
 “¿Que, que? Arcade? “Cabron, tu tienes un Nintendo en la casa.
 You have a Nintendo at home.”
 I’m like, “Oh, my God, I’m turning into my mom.
 Come on, dude, let’s go.”
 [imitates engine]
 I take him to this big old freaking arcade, right? And I felt so out of it because I didn’t know you couldn’t put money in the machines anymore.
 I’m— Man, I remember quarters.
 I’m thinking, “Here, five bucks,” and he’s, like, looking at me like, “Hmm?”
 “What? Go play,” and he’s like— he came right back.
 “All done.”
 I’m like, “Dude.”
 I didn’t know this.
 You have to go to another machine, put in money, and then it gives you a card, and then you swipe that card to play video games.
 And the game he wants to play doesn’t cost a quarter.
 It costs three dollars.
 A game.

 For those of you that don’t know the game, it’s pretty simple.
 It’s a dancing game, and there’s a big screen and then arrows come out to music, and whatever arrow comes out, that’s the arrow you have to step on when it comes out.
 Kind of cool, but all the music is techno and it’s loud.
 I know I’m getting older ’cause I’m like, “They got to turn that down.”

 Because you know what? Those roller coasters are not fluffy-friendly.
 Disney cares.

 And if you’re over 300 pounds, just stay in the parking lot.

 “The commercial said that Disneyland is the happiest place on Earth.”
 “Oh, my God.
 “That’s IHOP.
 The hell are we doing here?”
 We’re hanging out at IHOP, and, you know, we started talking, and it was kind of like a little bonding moment because Frankie— his dad isn’t in the picture and my dad wasn’t in the picture, so for some reason, you know, we got a little connection going on and it’s pretty cool.
 Frankie told me something, and it got me right here.
 He goes— you know, I’m talking to him.
 I said, “Frankie,” I says, “do you ever want to, you know, talk or see your real dad?”

 My buddy Noah— he’s trying to be helpful.
 He’s like, “Gabriel, don’t you have OnStar?”
 I’m like, “Yeah, but it’s in the car, stupid.”
 “Well, can’t you call the 800 number? Maybe they can track your car.”
 I’m like, “Oh, shoot, Noah, you’re a genius.”

 The straw was so thick, you could almost fit your thumb in it.
 So I grab the shake, and I begin to attempt to drink it.
 So I’m– Mmm.
 Mmm.
 Mmm.
 And I can see the shake coming up.
 Mmm.
 Mmm.
 And it hit, and then all of a sudden– Whoo!Hell, you guys even have taco trucks.
 Now for anyone wondering about taco trucks, let me just let you know right now.
 That is real good Mexican food.
 I don’t want you being concerned, like, “No, there’s wheels under that restaurant.”
 Well, sometimes we don’t have a permit, okay? But it doesn’t mean the food is not good.
 For me to know I’m gonna have a good experience at a taco truck, I always research.
 I look to see who’s running the truck.
 For me to know I’m gonna have a good time, I wanna make sure that it’s an all-female crew.
 Not to sound sexist.
 It’s just that when it’s all women running the truck, they make me feel good about myself.
 They make me feel special.
 When I walk up at one o’clock in the morning, and I have a buzz, they make me feel good.
 [imitates knocking]
 “Hello?”
 They come to the window.
 “Hola, mi gordito.
 ¿Cómo estás? ¿Cómo está ese gordito chulito? Ese gordito.
 Qué bonito.
 A ver.
 A ver.
 Ojitos.
 Ojitos.”
 I feel like a kid.
 I’m like, “Can I have a taco?”
 “Whatever you want, mi hijito.
 A taquito for you.”
 Now, when it’s an all Mexican male crew running the truck– It’s late.
 They’re tired.
 They’re bitter.
 Customer service isn’t our strongest point at one o’clock in the morning.
 Then you gotta deal with a drunk knucklehead like me.
 [imitates knocking]
 “Hello?”
 They come to the window.
 “¿Qué chingados quieres, pinche gordo? What you want? What you want?”
 “Hey, what’s up, bro? Can I have a taco?”
 “Okay.
 What else?”
 “That’s it.”
 [clicks tongue]
 “Aah!”
 That’s not even a word! But you know exactly what he just told you.
 For some reason, Mexican people, and only Mexican people, have this sound that comes out of us that can just discredit anything you put in front of it.
 It doesn’t matter what it is.
 We can kill it with that sound.
 “I just graduated from college, top of my class.”
 [clicks tongue]
 “Aah!”
 “Fine, I’ll work at Burger King.”
 “Papi, this is my fiancé.
 He loves me.”
 [clicks tongue]
 “Aah!”
 “Fine, I’ll be a whore.”
 And speaking of whores, let me tell you where they put us up at.
 That’s a bad segue.
 No.
 There’s no whores at this hotel.
Listen.
 I would like to personally thank the promoters for not only making this special happen, but for taking really good care of us.
 They put us at a hotel right across the street.
 And you know, you know when you’re in a good hotel when you get inside of the elevator, and it talks.
 It’s one of those.
 [imitates beep]
 [female voice]
 “First floor.”
 [imitates beep]
 “Second floor.”
 [imitates beep]
 “Third floor.”
 I’m like, “Man, she sounds hot.”
 [imitates beep]
 [female voice]
 “Fourth floor.
 Mmmm.”
 [imitates beep]
 “Fifth floor.
 Oh, yeah.”
 Martin asked me, “How far you going up?”
 I said, “All the way.”
----Punchline----
 I gotta see how this ends.

Oh, man.
 And by the way, since the last time we were here, I’ve had a few things change in my life.
 Some things happened that were so crazy that I couldn’t even believe it was a possibility.
 First thing that happened was, I had my first ever celebrity death hoax.
 Meaning that someone faked my death on the Internet, and it went viral.
 Someone wrote an amazing article that was read by over 30 million people that was so good, even I was like, “Oh, my God.
 I was so nice.”
 TMZ reported it for 30 minutes, until they called my publicist and confirmed that I was still alive.
 The article said that I had died October 31 from complications of Type II diabetes.
 And I’m thinking to myself, “That’s a hell of a day to kill a diabetic.”
 You know what I mean? That’s like killing Santa on Christmas Eve.
 Thirty million people read this article.
 No one thought to call me.
----Punchline----
 Except Martin.

 Martin was the only one that called me.
 And I think that was just to verify that he still had employment.
 I got that phone call.
 [imitates phone ringing, line connecting]
 “Hello?”
 Martin was like, “Hey.
 You dead?”
 “No, man.
 I’m good.”
 “I figured.
 You would’ve texted me.”
 [imitates line disconnecting]
 And I would have, ’cause that’s the kind of friend I am.
 I even asked my son, Frankie.
 I said, “Frankie, did you hear I died?”
 “That’s what they meant.”
 “What do you mean, ‘That’s what they meant’?”
 “My friends were asking if you were okay.”
 “What’d you tell them?”
 “I hadn’t seen you.”
 “So apparently I died.”
 “Welcome back.”
And that’s another thing that’s changed.

 “Mm-mmm.”
 I say, “You want to go to school in California, we’ll make it happen.
 You want to go out of state, we’ll make it happen.
 Hell, I’ll even do one of those international programs.”
 The ones where you give them one of your children and they give you one of their children.
 -What is it called when you kid-swap? -[audience]
 Exchange.
 Thank you.
 Sorry.
 That’s right.
 “Exchange.”
 Some of you were like, “That’s called human trafficking.”
 Different program.
 I would love to do an exchange program with my son.
 But don’t give me a regular kid.
 If I’m gonna do an exchange program, give me a kid from a hard-core third world country, so he appreciates all the basic things most American children take for granted.
 That’s why I say give me little Tombutu.
 Give me Tombutu.
 I would love Tombutu, and Tombutu would love me.
 “Mister Fluffy?”
 “Yes, Tombutu?”
 “I was wondering, what time do we go to sleep?”
 “You go to sleep whenever you like.
 This is your room.
 We sleep next door.”
 “All of this is for Tombutu?”
 “Yes, all of this is for Tombutu.”
 “In my village, two families sleep in an area this big.”
 “Well, here in America, one big-ass Mexican kid sleeps right here.
 Enjoy.”
 Then I would take him to IHOP or Denny’s and let him order whatever he wants and just watch him lose it.
 “This is the Thanksgiving I heard of! Thank you, Mr.
 Fluffy! Thank you! If there is anything Tombutu can do for you, please tell me.
 Anything.”
 “Can you help me take out the trash?”
 “For you, I will eat the trash.”


Meanwhile, my son’s on the other side of the world, on top of an elephant, trying to get Wi-Fi.
 I love my son very much, you guys.
 It’s just that sometimes he doesn’t get the position he’s in.
 He doesn’t realize it.
 Which is why I love it whenever he brings his friends over.
 He brings his friends over the house, and they’re constantly saying what I’m saying.
 And as a parent, anytime you tell your kids something, that’s one thing.
 When you can get their friends to say what you say, you can’t pay for that.
 And they’re always doing it.
 “Frankie, you’re lucky, man.
 Your dad’s trying to help you go to college.
 My dad wants me to get a job.
 Frankie, you’re lucky, man.
 Your dad’s trying to give you a car.
 My dad doesn’t even trust me to walk.
 You’re lucky, man.”
 And I hear this, and I’m like, “I love these kids.”
 Because my son is very numb to this situation.
 He’s very numb to all of you, and he’s very numb to “Fluffy.”
 Okay, he doesn’t see Fluffy.
 He sees “Dad! Dad!”
 I’m Dad.
 I’m the guy that tells him clean your room, take a shower and put on deodorant, which he does very well now! But you guys saw what I had to do to make that happen.


His friends, on the other hand, they still get excited when they see me.
 They still geek out.
 I walk into the living room.
 They’re all sitting there.
 Frankie sees me.
 “Hey, Dad.”
 His friends see me, they see this.
 [imitating chorus singing]
 With, like, doves.
 [imitates wings flapping]
 Can you imagine if every time you walked into a room, that happened? “He’s here.”
 [imitating chorus singing]
 [imitates wings flapping]
 Ladies, imagine if your partner could do that for you.
 Huh? It’s your anniversary, a celebration, some magical moment, or you’re just laying there and you’re drunk.
 And you’re just like, “What are you gonna do to me? What are you gonna do?”
 [imitating chorus singing]
 [imitates wings flapping]
 One extra dove.
 [imitates wings flapping]
 And by the way, guys, if you’re ever able to pull off the doves, just leave it at that.
 Don’t try to top the doves.
 It’s very hard to top the doves.
 Don’t start running your mouth and talking smack.
 She’s laying there.
 Don’t start: “You don’t know what’s gonna happen to you.
 You’re gonna get it.”
 Don’t do that.
 ’Cause ladies, all you have to do is look at him and go, [clicks tongue]
 “Aah!”


Anyways, back to my son’s friends.
 So my son has two friends that come to the house all the time.
 One friend, his name is Ken.
 Works a lot with computers.
 The other friend, his name is Fabian.
 He wants to be a police officer.
 Both of these kids are really good.
 Now I keep calling everyone kids, even though they’re all 18.
 But to me, they’re kids.
 I’m almost 40.
 I’m like, “Uh,” you know? Some of the conversations we have are very adult-like.
 And the other conversations, I’m like, “What am I doing with my life?”
For example, at home– At home, when I’m hanging out, I usually just wear very similar to now, except the Hawaiian shirt.
 I usually wear a T-shirt that has Star Wars or Marvel Comics or Transformers on it.
 Cartoons.
 I like wearing stuff like that around the house.
----Punchline----
 One day, I’m wearing a T-shirt that has The Avengers on the front.

 Yeah.
 And I walk into the living room, and my son’s friend Fabian sees me wearing the shirt.
 So he starts pointing.
 I’m like, “What’s up, dude?”
 He goes– [inhales]
 “Weak.”
 “’Scuse me?”
 “Weak.”
 And then he says, “DC’s better.”
 “What did you say?”
 “DC’s better.”
 I’m like, “DC’s okay.
 Obama lives there.
 They pass laws.
 They got hotels, historic museums.
 It’s not a real state.
 I don’t know why you’re getting cray-cray.”
 He goes, “No, fool! DC Comics!”
 I’m like, “Hey, man.
 I’m almost 40.
 I don’t care.
 It’s just a really cool shirt.
 I like it.
 It fits… No big deal.”
 “That’s ’cause they are.”
 “You need to relax.”
 “They’re the best.”
 “You need to chill.”
 And in my head, I’m like, why am I having this conversation? I have better things to do, like trying to get my son on an elephant, but no.
 The kid in me is, “Why are they best?”
 He points at the shirt again.
 “Iron Man sucks.
 Batman’s number one.”
 I go, “Why?”
 “’Cause he is.”
 I go, “That’s not an argument.
 First of all, Batman’s not the best superhero.
 I hate to break it to you.

 “No, chingue su madre, soy Batman, loco– Todo el pinche día aquí trabajando y luego le parta la madre Joker–” “I’m Batman.”
 I said, “All right, Fabian, Mr.
 ‘Batman’s The Best.
’ Based on my T-shirt– My T-shirt says Marvel Comics.
 I see Thor, I see Captain America, I see Iron Man.
 Who are some of the superheroes that DC Comics has that makes them better than Marvel? Go.”
 “Batman.”
 “You said that.”
 “Superman.”
 “That’s a good one.”
 “Wonder Woman.”
 “Okay.”
 “Green Lantern.”
 “Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.”
 I said, “I know the other superheroes, but Green Lantern? What’s his power?”
 “He wears a ring, and the ring gives him power.”
 I said, “That’s a fantasy.
 I don’t know any man who wears a ring who has power.”
 And if you’re not clapping right now, my point exactly.
 You can’t clap, can you? You can’t.
 You know why you can’t clap? ’Cause you’re sitting next to Kryptonite.

 And they get so excited and so involved with the show, that they forget.
 They forget to do a very basic thing.
 Called breathing! You’d be amazed how many times I’ve seen this in the front row.
 And they pass the hell out.
 The messed-up part is only I can see what’s happening.
 And– And they’re usually, like, “Fluffy, do something.”
 I’m, like– “Do something!”
 [imitating chorus singing]
 [imitating wings flapping]
 “He woke up! Thank you!”


I had a lady one time… up in the balcony… who laughed herself unconscious.
 She went forward and wound up hitting her head on the rail that was in the aisle.
 Now I couldn’t see this because I’m onstage and I had spotlights in my face.
 It wasn’t until after the show was over, when Martin came back out onstage and he took the microphone.
 Then he tells me in my ear, “Bro, some lady just got hurt in the balcony.
 The paramedics are here.
 They have her in the lobby.
 Let’s check on her.”
 I’m like, “Let’s go.”
 So we go behind the curtain.
 Security is waiting for us with the car.
 So we jump in the car– [imitates door closing, engine revving]
 They raced us around to the front of the building.
 Now as soon as we get to the front, we see an ambulance.
 We start walking in.
 And now– Not to take anything away from this serious moment, because this really did happen.
 It’s a little bit funny in the sense that… my show just finished, and people are now starting to leave the building.
 They just saw me onstage a minute ago.
 Now they see me walking in the front door.
 You gotta see it through my eyes.
 “He’s big, but he’s fast.
 I don’t know how he did that one.
 That’s pretty good.”
 I come in, and immediately I cut right, to where the lady and the paramedics are sitting on the steps to the balcony.
 The lobby is starting to fill up with people.
 I’m trying to get from point A to point B without getting stopped.
 So I started doing this, and I know it’s gonna look a little weird, but it worked.
 “Are you okay? Are you all right?”
 People see me doing this, and immediately they’re puzzled.
 The way you looked at me now, like that.
 And they did this.
 “What the hell’s he doing?”
 It made everybody take two steps back and do like this.
 It created a hole for me to get to them.
 Then they see the paramedics, and they realize what I was trying to do.
 Everything was fine till I got really close.
 And then one of the paramedics calls me out.
 “What are you doing to the lady?”
 I go, “Listen, sir.
 The woman obviously sustained a head injury.
 I’m giving her a chance to process the fact that it’s really me.
 And I’m slowly… getting closer to her.
 I realize now that I’m in this incredible position where I can no longer walk up from behind someone at one of my shows and go, ‘Hey!’” “Why not?”
 “Cause then– ‘Clear!’” “Fluffy killed another one.”
 [imitates kick]
 So finally the lady looks up.
 She must have been 55, 60, little Asian woman.
 She sees me, and she’s, like– [breathing heavily]
 “You too funny.
 You almost a-kill me!”
 “I am so sorry.
 Are you okay? Is there anything I could do to make you feel better?”
 “Yes.
 Yes, feel better.
 I would like two T-shirt.”
 “I’m gonna get you two T-shirts.”
 “And two DVD.”
 I’m like, “You’re not that hurt.
 Get your ass over here.”
 So I stand her up, and immediately one of the paramedics– “Hey.
 She hit her head.
 She shouldn’t be standing.”
 I said, “I’m the artist performing here tonight.
 I accept full responsibility over this woman.
 I got her.
 It’s cool.”
 Plus, she’s tiny.
 We’re only walking ten feet to the merchandise table.
 No big deal.
 I say, “Come on.
 I got you.
 Let’s go.”
 As soon as we start walking, she starts venting.
 [breathing heavily]
 “Mr.
 Fluffy.
 You have no idea kind of week I have.
 My son, he marry this girl.
 She no cook, no clean.
 Move into my house.
 Now I have to cook and clean for two.
 Oh, some bullshit.”
 And I’m like, “Oh, my God.
 That’s gonna happen to me.”
 “Mr.
 Fluffy, I must apologize to you because I do not know who you are until today.
 I have a friend who give me ticket.
 She say, ‘Susie, you stress so much.
 You need to get out.
 Husband win ticket in raffle.
 Only have one ticket.
 You take it.
’ So I look at the ticket.
 Ticket say, ‘The Fluffy.
’ I don’t know what comedy show is because I never go comedy show.
 I see ‘Fluffy,’ I think is musical like Cats.
 I say, ‘Okay.
 I go see Fluffy Cats.
’ So I come here early so I can get the popcorn and the soda.
 So I sit and I wait for Fluffy Cats.
 Next thing I know, your friend Martin, he walk out onstage with the big hair, big goatee.
 I say, ‘Oh, ho, ho.
 This not Cats.
 This not Cats.
 This Lion King.
 That’s a Mexican Mufasa.
’ And he start crack jokes.
 I start laugh, laugh.
 I laugh.
 Then you come out onstage.
 I cannot take.
 I can’t breathe.
 I black out.
 And when I wake up, I have ice pack on the head, blood in the eye, and the two young white paramedics, they both touch me right here.
 They say, ‘Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay?’” “What did you tell them?”
 “Ho-ho.
 ‘Never better.
’ Susie never have two young white men touch me right here, same time.
 Oh, your show very special, Mr.
 Fluffy.
 Very special.
 You show like Make-A-Wish.
 If I have a scar–” “You’re gonna sue me.”
 “No.
 No, no, no, no, no.
 No! Not going to sue.
 If I have a scar, and the friends ask me, ‘Hey.
----Punchline----
 How you get scar?’… now I have great story to tell.

 [mouths words]
 I get her back to the paramedics.
 The paramedics are like, “She’s a handful, huh?”
 I’m like, “Oh, yeah.
 She’s horny.
 She likes you.
 Here you go.”


As soon as I turn around, all I see is a lobby full of people and a bunch of cell phones.
 There’s footage of what I just told you out there.
 Everybody was recording what happened.
 What I thought was cool is everybody waited for me to finish with the lady and the paramedics.
 All of a sudden, when I turned around– [imitates whooshing]
 People started coming up.
 Some people wanted to shake my hand, some people wanted to high-five.
 One guy just wanted to hug me, and he didn’t say anything.
 He just hugged me, just– “Are you okay?”
 [shaky breathing]
 “You sure?”
 [shaky breathing]
 “All right.”
 Couple of kids are looking at me, like– And for me, I thought that was so cute, because I recognized that twinkle.
 I’ve looked at someone like that before.
I’ve been starstruck many, many times.
 As a matter of fact, this past year, I got to meet one of my childhood heroes.
----Punchline----
 I got to meet Arnold Schwarzenegger.

 Now some of you are clapping, some of you are like, “Wait, wait, wait.”
 Here’s the thing.
 I didn’t love him as a politician, and I was too young to know him as a bodybuilder.
 All I knew was The Terminator was my favorite movie, and he was the Terminator.
 So, here’s the story.
 I’m in LA, at this red carpet event for some movie I still haven’t seen.
 I’m standing there with my publicist, okay? I’m standing there with my publicist, and she’s explaining to me how the red carpet works.
 “Listen, Gabriel.
 This is what’s gonna happen.
 You’re gonna go down the red carpet, and then the paparazzi’s gonna start taking photos of you, and then someone’s gonna ask you some questions.
 It’s a lot of fun.
 Then we’ll go inside, and we’ll go to the after-party.
 It’s gonna be great.”
 As she’s telling me this, I’m looking around, and I look over and I notice– I see him.
 I see Arnold Schwarzenegger.
 And I freak out.
 [stammering, babbling]
 “It’s Arnold Schwarzenegger! It’s Arnold Schwarzenegger!”
 “Relax.
 Relax.
 You’ve never met Arnie?”
 I said, “No, I’ve never met Arnie.”
 “I work with him all the time.
 He’s really nice.
 Would you like me to introduce you?”
 I’m like, “Yes!”
 She takes me by the hand, and she walks me directly to Arnold.
 I’m freaking out so bad.
 I look like a big-ass toddler.
 We get over to Arnold Schwarzenegger’s area.
 He’s Arnold Schwarzenegger.
 He’s already got a big group of people around him, waiting to take a photo.
 So I’m just patiently waiting.
 As I’m watching him, you guys– I gotta tell you right now.
 No one on this planet is better at meeting people than Arnold Schwarzenegger.
 He is the greatest people-meeter I’ve ever witnessed.
 The reason I say this is because when you meet him, he’s very engaging.
 He grabs your hand.
 He pulls you in.
 He looks at you in the eyes and he turns it on.
 When you meet Arnold, you get exactly what you think you’re gonna get.
 It’s awesome to watch.
 [imitating Arnold Schwarzenegger]
 “How are you? So nice to meet you.
 You so strong.
 You pump iron? Ay! Look at you! This is incredible, got these lights and this red carpet.
 ’Scuse me.
 How are you? Ay! You so strong! You pump iron? This is incredible.
 Look at you.”
 People are walking away from him, looking at their hand.
 They’re looking at their hand, you guys.
 Ten minutes I’m watching Arnold Schwarzenegger light people up.
 Then I notice something else.
 I notice that Arnold has a handler, a guy who stands right behind him.
 And it’s this guy’s job to basically reset Arnold for the next person he’s about to meet.
 Arnold Schwarzenegger will never cut off a conversation with a fan.
 The guy behind him listens in on the conversation, and he determines when enough is enough, and then he signals Arnold to cut it off and move on.
 Here’s the signal.
 He grabs the back of Arnold’s arm, right there, two times.
 One, two.
 That lets Arnold know: cut it off, time to move on.
 Always to the left.
 Awesome to watch.
 “This is incredible with these lights and these special effects going on here.
 ’Scuse me.
 How are you? Nice to meet you.
 You so strong.
 Ay!”
 I’m, like– [gasps]
 So I yell out to the handler, “Hey!”
 And the handler turns around.

 “’Scuse me.

 Pardon me.
 High five.
 High five.
 ’Scuse me.
 Hello.
 How are you? Pound, pound, pound pound.”
 He’s coming down the line, coming down the line, and I’m just waiting.
 [heavy exhale]
 I stick my hand out, and he grabbed it.
 “How are you? So– I recognize you.
 I know who you are.
 You’re that comedian who does the joke about the Indian man trying to rob a bank, but he cannot rob the bank because they are making fun of him.”
 And in my head, I’m, like– [squealing]
 “He knows me!”
 Outside, I’m like, “Yeah, that’s me.”
 “You are hysterical.
 Give me your contact information.
 You are the funniest person– ’Scuse me.
 How are you? Nice to meet you.
 You so strong.”
 “Hey!”
 Meeting Arnold is like a really good roller coaster.
 You want to go to the end and meet him one more time.
 It was so cool because I’m watching him– And people started recording him.
For me, it’s one of those things where I’m finding myself in a very interesting situation right now, because I like hanging out, I like going out.
 I’ve been drunk in Chicago many, many times.
 I like to have fun.

 It’s not a guarantee, but I am guaranteed a pilot.
 Here’s the problem.
 ABC is owned… by Disney.
 Disney is such a huge brand that anytime someone threatens the way you look at that brand, they are dealt with in a very un-Disney-like way.
 This sitcom that I’m producing is about me.
 I play myself.
 I play Gabriel Iglesias.
 It’s about me, my family, my friends.
 My friend Martin… is not allowed on the show.
 Not per me.
 Take it up with the Mouse.
 They look at your social media.
 They look at your stuff online.
 If there’s anything about you that doesn’t fit that model, they will freaking– mmmm.
 And I’m paranoid, because Disney’s so big.
 They’re so huge.
 They own television stations.
 They own radio stations.
 They own Marvel Comics.
 They own Star Wars.
 I don’t need that phone call, you know? [imitates phone ringing, line connecting]
 “Hello?”
 [imitating Yoda]
 “Mmm.
 Fucked up, you did.”
 I’m so freaking paranoid, you guys.
 Because nowadays, people are always recording.
 If you do something that might look stupid, it can end up turning out even worse.
 For example, say I fall off the stage tonight and someone’s recording that.
 If TMZ gets ahold of that, it can go viral.
 And God forbid, something happens to me, it can make the news.
 [imitating reporter]
 “We’re standing here in front of the Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Illinois, where authorities believe Fluffy lost control.
 The 39-year-old comedian was found dead for the second time in two years.

That’s why I’m saying I gotta be careful, because I still enjoy my habits.
 I still like drinking.
 Of course, some people pull me aside and say, “Gabriel, why do you drink? Why do you drink? You have so many responsibilities and people you take care of.
 Why do you drink?”
 “Because I have a lot of responsibilities and people to take care of.”
 Some of you already know because you’ve been to my shows in the past.
 My poison of choice is tequila.
 Certain alcohol I no longer mess with anymore.
 Like, I no longer mess with Jäger.
 [people shouting]
 See, first of all, any alcohol that will make you say its name… is not safe.
 That’s the only alcohol that will make you do that.
 That’s the only one you hear people– “Jäger!”
 You don’t hear anyone else.
 You don’t hear Mexicans– “¡Tequila! ¡Güey!”
 You don’t hear black people– “Hennessy, playa.”
 You don’t hear Japanese– “Whoo! Sake! Sake!”
 Jäger is scary for a few reasons.
 One, I’m Type II diabetic.
 I shouldn’t even be drinking.
 But Jäger has twice as much sugar in it.
 Second thing is the consistency.
 It’s very sticky.
 It’s like cough syrup.
 So if you drink too much of it, it holds on longer than anything else.
 And it’s nasty.
 When you drink it, you’re, like– [groans, coughs]
 Pa la tos.
 Pa la tos.
 It’s horrible.
 If you drink too much of it, it holds on longer than anything else.
 You know? If you have one too many beers, you know what happens.
 You get the– [gurgles]
 Then you return it to the rightful owner.
 Jäger makes you feel like you gotta bring it back, but you can’t.
 All it does it make you dramatic for 45 minutes until it lets go.
 You’ve seen someone like that.
 “Hey, you okay?”
 “I’m fine, bro–” [retches]
 They can’t throw up.
 All they’re doing is six-minute abs.
 [grunting]
 People look at you the next day.
 “Are you into fitness?”
 “No, I’m a drunk.”
 Man, Jäger is scary.


Another alcohol I refuse to mess with anymore… is wine.
 Look at the people– [clearing throat]
 “We’re from Schaumburg.”
 Those of you that don’t know, Schaumburg is the Beverly Hills of the area, so– I’m sure you figured that out.
 Um– My issue with wine is very simple.
 I don’t like the fact that wine is socially accepted.
 What I mean by that is that if you see someone with a bottle of wine, if you see a guy crossing the street with a bottle of wine, immediately he’s judged, but in a positive way, because wine is always associated with something high-class, something positive, something progressive, an anniversary, a celebration, a promotion.
 So you try to figure it out.
 “What do you think is going on over there? Graduation? Promotion? It’s gotta be good.
 Hey, good for you, buddy.”
 Women see a man with a bottle of wine, holding a couple of glasses, and immediately– [imitates woman’s voice]
 “Aw! Lucky bitch.”


It’s still alcohol.
 It will still mess you up.
 The main reason why I don’t like wine is because you cannot accurately measure wine.
 You can measure real liquor.
 It’s called a shot.
 And you know after drinking enough times what you can handle and what you can’t handle.
 Because people who drink a lot love to brag about their drinking abilities.
 -They have their drinking number.
 Right? -[audience member shouts]
 They have their drinking number.
 You’ll hear ’em, you know.
 “Eleven shots of Don Julio.
 Whoo! Yeah!”
 They have their drinking number, even women.
 [imitates woman’s voice]
 “After four shots of Cuervo, I am so good.
 Four shots is my sweet spot.”
 [low voice]
 “What happens if you do five?”
 “I’ll wake up in an alley.”
 “What happens if you do six?”
 “That’s how I met Tyrone.”
 [mouthing words]


See, with wine you cannot accurately measure how much you’re drinking unless you’re basing it on the bottle.
 And if you’re basing it on the bottle, then that’s a whole different issue.
 With wine, the glasses are always different sizes.
 Sometimes they’re big glasses.
 Sometimes they’re small glasses.
 And a lot of times you need to rely on someone to pour it for you.
 Sometimes they know what they’re doing.
 Sometimes they don’t.
 Sometimes they fill it up too high, which is not the proper amount.
 Sometimes they get it just right, which is a little bit less than half of the glass.
 Sometimes you get that greedy bastard from Olive Garden.
 You get that little sample.
 You have to hold it up in direct sunlight and do this.
 Then you drink it.
 “That’s pretty good.
 I got a coupon.
 Here you go.”


And you never see wine drinkers drinking with real drinkers in dive bars.
 You might see ’em at a social gathering like this one or some corporate function, but never at a little hole in the wall.
 You’ll never see– “Jäger!”
 “¡Tequila! ¡Güey!”
 And in the middle– [English accent]
 “Merlot, I say.
 Oh, this is a fantastic establishment.
 I truly enjoy the decor here.
 This is amazing.
 This is brilliant, I tell you.
 Who cuts your grass? It’s fantastic.”
 I’m sorry.
 That voice always makes me laugh.
 I like it.
 It makes me smile, you know, when we’re here… in America.
 Whenever I travel and I perform in England, -that voice takes on a different meaning.

 All right.
 Let me tell the rest of the people about you.
 I love it whenever people from the UK come here to the United States, because when we hear you speak, you sound incredible, you sound amazing, you sound educated, you sound inspirational.
 That accent is so proper.
 It is so proper.
 It doesn’t matter what you’re talking about, we’re drawn to whatever it is.
 You could be talking about trash, it sounds amazing.
 “Who could leave all this rubbish here? This is such a travesty.
 This is– All this destruction here all over the sidewalk.
 Someone must tend to this at once.
 This is ridiculous.”
 People are listening in.
 “I don’t know what happened over there, but the shit hit the fan.
 That guy from England is pissed.
 I don’t know.
 What the hell is ‘rubbish’?”


See, it’s very different.
 Now, when one of us goes over there, man, it’s very, very different, because, see, we don’t sound the same as them.
 As a matter of fact, as Americans, we have a certain way with the English language.
 Do you understand how we sound to them? I mean, seriously, do you know how they look at us when they hear us speak? We sound like this to them: [Southern accent]
 “I’ll tell you, the other day I was hanging out with Phil.
 That sumbitch come over to the house.
 We had ourselves a good old time.
 Just me and Phil.”
 By the way, if you sound like that here tonight, I’m kidding.
 They’re just jokes.
 Don’t feel like just, you know, “I’m-a wait for his ass outside.
 I’ll see how funny he is when he gets to the parking lot.
 Fluffy, my ass.”
 I just think it’s funny… that, no matter what they talk about over there, they sound the same.
 It sounds the same, you know.


Whereas with us, Americans, we speak according to our environment.
 We change it up.
 We morph.
 We adapt.
 We all have our– For example, we all have our “trying to get a good job” voice.
 When you walk in for that interview, you don’t sound the way you sound on a Saturday night when you’re having a couple drinks.
 You clean it up.
 You practice in the car.
 And when you walk in, you turn it on.
 “If you’ll check my references, you’ll see I’m more than qualified for this position.
 Please feel free to call Frank Torres.
 Frank will tell you the amazing job I did for him two and a half weeks ago.
 Listen, I’m ready to work seven days a week, 365 days a year.
 No job is too big.
 No task is too small.
 You can count on me.
 I’m the right person for the job.
 Please keep me in mind.

You guys know we all have our daytime voice that we have around our family and our friends and our children, you know.

 “Jäger!”
 And then, if you’re lucky enough, you have your late, late, late night voice.

 “If you’ll pour the wine, I will drink it.

I see a couple of young adults there.
 How old are you guys? -Thirteen.

 Thirteen.
 Wow.
 And next to you? -[Gabriel]
 How old are you? -Ten.
 You’re ten.
 [gasps]
 Okay.
 I am so sorry for what Martin said.
 Ten years old.
 I can’t feel too bad because you know what? Ten-year-olds are young adults.
 You are a young adult.
 I don’t see you as a kid.
 A kid to me, first of all, is someone who doesn’t have access to the Internet.
 You have, I’m sure, a tablet, a cell phone or access to online services, right? Services.
 “What the hell is he talking about?”
 Bad choice of words.
 You know what I mean, right? You’ve probably seen and heard a few things already.
 And the parents are like, “No, not my child.
 I lock their phone.”
 Yeah, but you don’t lock their friend’s phone.
 I feel bad whenever I say something that’s kind of, like, risqué whenever parents bring a four-year-old, five-year-old, six-year-old.
 And, yes, it happens.
 Then I feel bad.
 I’ll meet ’em after the show and I’m like, “I am so sorry for what you heard me say.”
 And it’s always funny to see the parents say, “Oh, they hear worse at home.”

 Let me tell you right now, I love my dressing room for the simple fact that it has basic things that I really like, like light switches.
 A lot of these arenas are now starting to go green.
 So they’re taking away the light switches and they’re replacing ’em with sensors.
 Sensors are cool when they work.
 Know what I mean? You’re ten feet away, it senses you, and the whole room just– [imitates electrical hum]

In addition, backstage my sink has knobs on it.
 I have control of the temperature and pressure of the water, which in the Chicago area, I believe, is very important, especially in the winter.
 Oh, man, you guys are no joke in the winter.
 You need warm water when you wash your hands.
 You can’t rely on a sensor that gives you nothing but cold water, ’cause you wash your hands with cold water, your hands get all cryptic.
 You go outside, people are making fun of you.
 “Lookit.
 ‘Thriller.
’” My dressing room, you guys, has a sink that has hot and cold– You can control the water.
 You can control the temperature.
 You can control the pressure.
 I hate it when they take that away from us and replace it with that little sensor.
 So now, in addition to being a comedian, now I gotta be a magician.
 I’m not a magician, but if you watch me wash my hands, that’s what I look like.
 Nothing.
 Then you walk away.

 I like a good soap dispenser.
 I like the, you know, the pump, the– [imitates soap dispenser squirting]
 I hate it when they take that away from us and then they replace it with that little spout that goes next to the faucet.
 You stick your hand under it, and it gives you that little booger of soap.
 You know what I mean? That little moco.
 You put it under.
 You– [imitates dispenser spitting]
 You need more.
 So you pull it out and then go back in.
 But the sensor’s like, “No.
 It’s still you.”
 Now you gotta trick it, right? Once you get enough soap on your hands, you gotta try to wash it off.
 But you can’t wash it off then because the timer for the water has timed out.
 So now you have to back up and now you have to put on a second performance.
 Now it’s a race to get that soap off your hands.


Once you get the soap off your hands, now you gotta try to dry your hands.
 Some places still give you a towel.
 Some places give you paper towels.
 Some take the paper towels and put ’em in a box on the wall with another sensor.
 And there you are.
 [imitates dispenser humming, paper tearing]
 Three inches of paper.
 Three inches, Chicago.
 You can’t do anything with three inches.
 Ask any woman.
 They’ll tell you.
 Or a guy.
 I’m equal opportunity.
 I need control of the paper.
 I need the crank, the– [imitates dispenser cranking]
 [imitates paper tearing]
 [squeaking sound]


Some places stop there.
 Some places keep going.
 Have you ever walked into the bathroom stall… close the door, locked it, turned around, looked at the toilet and seen a blinking red light on the wall? And you’re like, “Really? Here too?”
 All you’re trying to do is get the tissue paper off the wall for the toilet seat.
 You take one step– [imitates toilet flushing]
 I haven’t even done anything.
 You grab the paper.
 [imitates paper crinkling]
 [imitates paper whooshing]
 [imitates toilet flushing]
 Hey! [imitates paper crinkling, whooshing]
 You turn around and you put it on like a cape.
 [imitates paper whooshing]
 And you let it slide down your back while you slowly try to time it just right.
 Just as you’re about to sit down, somebody walks into the bathroom and distracts you.
 [imitates door clicking]
 Huh? [imitates toilet flushing]
 But it’s too late.
 Your knees are bent.
 And unless you do CrossFit, you’re not coming back from that one.
 Then your bare ass touches the seat… and you’re like, “Aah!”
 And just when you think it can’t get any worse– [imitates toilet flushing]
 And all this water’s splashing up, hitting you right in the ass.
 And then the water goes down the drain and it creates that air vortex that goes right between your legs.
 So now you have a tsunami in the back, you have a tornado in the front.
 And who’s the victim? [high-pitched voice]
 Pikachu.
 And he’s holding on for dear life.
 You haven’t even made magic yet, and you’ve already been violated by plumbing.


Now you do what you need to do.
 You finish.
 Now it’s time for clean-up, time for maintenance.
 So you reach over for the toilet paper.
 And the problem with using the restroom nowadays is that most venues, including this one, instead of putting a human-size toilet paper roll inside of the human-size toilet paper roll dispenser… they take their ass to Costco or Sam’s Club or one of these places where you buy in bulk, and they buy that giant gorilla roll of toilet paper.
 Then they come back here and they force it into that little tiny compartment… and then they close the door on it.
 [imitates door latching]
 So now this giant wheel is locked in place.
 You can’t even spin it.
 You’re just– [grunting]
 You can’t even find where it starts because they glue it.
 Out of desperation you gotta pull out your car keys and cut into the side of it like a bag of cocaine on Narcos.
 Then you get the paper.
 [imitates paper whooshing, snapping]
 You try to wipe.
 [imitates scraping sound]
 [screams]


Chicago, a year from now, a year from now I am predicting that they are going to take 100% control of the restroom.
 You’re gonna be sitting there, and you’re gonna think of me ’cause you’re gonna see it.
 You’re gonna look over to get the toilet paper, and there’s gonna be a blinking red light on it.
----Punchline----
 And you’re gonna be like, “Oh, my God, Fluffy called it.”

 I am so sorry, bro.
 That was a lot.
 “Damn!”
Yeah.
 You guys, I understand.
 I understand why they do this to our restrooms, why they put sensors in places, because they’re trying to save energy, they’re trying to save water.
 I live in California.
 We need water.
 Okay? We do.
 But some places need sensors, some places don’t.
 Some places are good at teaching us how to conserve energy and conserve water.
 Some places are horrible at it, like the hotel that we’re staying at.
 They have a very basic thing that they do.
 They have a little cardboard sign that hangs on the towel rack in the bathroom.
 All it says is, “Please help save water by reusing your towel.”
 On the back, a diagram shows you the millions of gallons of water that are saved every year when people reuse their towel.
 I reuse ’em at home.
 I got no problem doing that at the hotel.
 It’s my towel.
 Some people don’t want to reuse their towels.
 They’re like, “That towel’s dirty.”
 Well, if that towel’s dirty, then you suck at showers.
 Because theoretically that white towel should be white every single time you use it.
 But, no, people like to roll it up and then go expert mode with it.
 And now you waste more water trying to get that out.


Like I said, some places are good at teaching us how to save energy, save water.
 Some places are horrible at it.
 I was at a university not too long ago very close to here.
 And this university has a lot of money, so much so that they have their own private police department on campus.
 It’s only for the campus.
 Now, that’s not a big deal.
 There’s a lot of colleges that have their own on-campus police.
----Punchline----

 My thing is that, if you’re an officer of the law… it’s your job to fight crime.
 The first thing that people see when you arrive on a scene is your mode of transportation.
 Your vehicle needs to establish dominance of the situation before you set one foot outside.
 In California, over 65% of California Highway Patrol officers now drive SUVs.
 So when you get stopped over there, you feel it.
 You’re intimidated by it.

 I gotta start being careful, you guys, because I’m noticing now, after six specials, that a lot of my material, a lot of my stories are starting to come back to haunt me.
 Some of them in good ways, some of them not so good.
 For example, in 1997… on TV one time, one time, I said, “I love chocolate cake.”
 One time.
 Nineteen years later, people are still bringing me chocolate cakes.
 That is crazy.
 I mean, think about that.
 Nineteen years ago, and I’m still getting cake.
 I’ve only said it one time.
 Next thing you know, I talked about how much I love diet sodas.
 Next thing you know, people started bringing me diet sodas.
 In the following special, Aloha Fluffy, I started talking about how my son’s growing a little bit older and the hormones are kicking in and he needed to use deodorant.
 Next thing you know, his friends started bringing deodorant and people started bringing deodorant to my shows for me to give to my son.

 The story itself is about 15 minutes long, okay? I’m gonna give you the three-minute version of that story so you understand what’s going on.
 Basically, Martin and I are doing a show in Sacramento, California.
 We’re driving from LA to Sacramento.
 We’re passing through a small town called Fresno.
 As we’re passing through Fresno, we reach out to the local promoter who does the shows there.
 We’re good friends with him.
 And he tells us, you know, ’cause we’re trying to have lunch– And he goes, “He’s busy.
 But by the way, G Reilly’s in town.”
 And we’re like, “Oh, shoot, our friend G Reilly’s in town.”
 “He’s at the hotel.”
 “All right, he’s at the hotel.”
 We knew exactly where he was at.
 So I say, “Martin, how about we go and visit G?”
 Martin goes, “Let’s stop by.”
 I figured first let’s pick up some sodas, some drinks so we can surprise him.
 We get to the market.
 We walk in the door, we see a whole pile of gift baskets.
 Martin goes, “We should get him a gift basket.”
 I said, “Martin, G Reilly doesn’t like gift baskets, okay? He doesn’t like the fancy wine and the fancy cheese and the sausage.
----Punchline----
 He definitely hates crackers.”

 I said, “How about this, Martin? He doesn’t know we’re coming.
 Let’s have fun with him.
 How about we make him a racist gift basket?”
 And Martin goes, “What’s that?”
 I go, “You know, Martin, a racist gift basket, a gift basket designed to have fun with whatever race you’re trying to mess with.”
 Now, in G’s case, he’s black.
 It was easy.
 Now, I say easy not to be an ass.
 I say easy because there are so many stereotypes attached to African Americans.
 So we had this empty gift basket.
 What did we put in it? Fried chicken, watermelon, Kool-Aid, grape soda, barbecued potato chips, sunflower seeds, an Ebony magazine, a Chris Rock DVD called Bigger and Blacker, Magnum condoms, Newport cigarettes, a rack of ribs, the recipe for corn bread.
 We put everything but a white girl with a big ass in the basket.
 We wrapped it up really nice, we put a big bow on it and took it to the hotel.
 We had the girl at the front desk deliver it to his room.
 Martin and I are waiting in the hallway where he can’t see us.
 So she knocks on the door.
 [imitates knocking]
 G Reilly opens the door.
 She gives him the gift basket.
 He says, “Thank you,” closes the door.
 [imitates door closing]
 Martin and I run to the door, and we start listening to him opening up the gift basket.
 As he’s opening it, he’s getting excited.
 And he is enjoying every single thing he is pulling out of that basket.
 He is loving this basket until he realizes it’s a practical joke, and then he freaks out because he read the greeting card.
 The greeting card freaked him out because now he thinks that the KKK sent the gift basket.
 Some of you are like, “Why does he think that?”
 ’Cause that’s what we wrote.
 If you’re gonna do a practical joke, you go big or you go home.
----Punchline----

 the diet soda… and the deodorant… before you know it, people started bringing me… Mexican racist gift baskets.
 Now, when it first started happening– Listen, guys, I’m not gonna lie.
 It was actually kind of cute because it was only other Mexicans bringing me these “Mexican racist gift baskets.”
 It started in LA after a show.
 This one guy walks up to me with a basket, and he’s like, “Hey, what’s up, homey? Got you a racist gift basket.”
 I said, “We’re the same race.”
 “Hey, whatever.”
 “All right, whatever.”
 I take it backstage, and all the items in the basket made it to my house.
 There was a Mexican blanket with a tiger on it, a bunch of bottles of Fanta, bottles of sangria, Vicente Fernández CDs, Mexican candy, pan dulce, sweet bread, mazapanes.
 Everything made it to my house.
 Now… the more East Coast we started traveling and the more Down South we started performing… the more… creative… the gift baskets started getting.

 Oh, it gets good.
 Earlier tonight, before we kicked off this special, my friend Martin was out here making a couple of announcements.
 One of the announcements that he made was, “If you brought a gift, please hold on to it until after the show.
 Don’t bring it to the stage.
 It could interrupt the flow of the performance.”


The only reason why he makes this announcement every single night is because of one show in Mobile.
 So here’s what happens.
 I tell the entire “Racist Gift Basket Story,” the full 16 minutes, right? As soon as I finish, a guy from the back of the theater rushes the front of the stage.
 Now keep in mind this area is full.
 In Mobile the aisle was right up the middle.
 So the guy had a clean shot to me.
 He hauled ass like it was The Price Is Right all the way down.
 [imitating motor revving]
 Much like tonight, there was security there that night.
 Security sees the guy with the basket, but no one thought to stop him.
 All they did was, [Southern accent]
 “That’s pretty.”
 “Oh, that’s nice.
 That’s pretty, yeah.”
 So the guy makes it all the way to the front, takes the gift basket, and he puts it on the stage.
 Now he’s heckling me from where you’re sitting.
 I’m standing here and he’s like, “Fluffy!”
 “What’s up, dude?”
 [Southern accent]
 “I got this for you.”
 Thank you.
 “Open it.”
 I go, “Sir, we’re in the middle of a show right now.”
 I says, “I appreciate the gift.
 That’s very nice of you.
 But how about this? I’ll open it after the show.”
 “Oh, come on, Fluffy.
 I wanna see your face.”
 “Sir, how about this? How about you take the gift basket and bring it to the side where security’s at? And I’ll have security escort you behind the curtain.
 And then I’ll open it up backstage with you in front of me.
 How’s that?”
 And he’s not taking no for an answer.
 Now the problem is the crowd just saw me tell “The Racist Gift Basket Story,” and all of a sudden there’s a guy with a gift basket.
 They have no idea I’m not affiliated with freakin’ Duck Dynasty in the front row.
 So now I’m trying to defuse the situation before it gets crazy, but he’s not taking no for an answer.
 Next thing you know, he does something no other audience member has ever done in my 19-plus years as a comedian.
 He takes the whole crowd away from me, flips ’em, and then uses ’em on me… in five seconds.
 It was the most amazing, horrific thing I have ever witnessed.
 This is all he did: [Southern accent]
 “Come on, Fluffy! We wanna see your face! We wanna see your face! We wanna see your–” He gets 2,000 people behind him to start chanting.
 [whispering loudly]
 “We wanna see your face.
 We wanna see your face.”
 It was very evident this was not the first rally he’s ever led.
 The crowd is so loud, I can no longer hear myself over the monitor.
 So I’m like– I lost.
 So I get on my hands and knees.
 I put the microphone down, I grab the gift basket, and I start tearing it open.
 I reach in.
 Forget about pulling out Mexican soda, Mexican candy or a Mexican blanket.
 This dude was a pro.
 I started pulling out gardening tools.
 I’m pulling out a rake, a toy shovel, a toy leaf blower.
 [Southern accent]
 “Dig deeper, Fluffy! Dig deeper!”
 I pull out a soccer ball.
 I go, “Dude, it says Puerto Rico.”
 “They ran out of Mexico.”
 I pull out a brick.
 I go, “What’s the brick for?”
 “The wall.”
 I pull out an actual application for US citizenship.
 [audience gasping]
 I said, “There’s no way this can get any worse.”
 “Dig deeper!”
 I was wrong.

 And I showed him the application.
 And he’s like– [screams]
 “You’re not my friend.
 Not my friend.”
 So I walk into the dressing room, you guys, and I’m pissed, man.
 I walk in.
 I close the door.
 [imitates door slamming]
 Put the basket down.
 I’m scratching my head.
 I’m trying to think, “What could I have done to have prevented that from getting to where it went? Should I have grabbed the gift basket, moved it out of the way? Should I have had security grab the guy? Grab the gift basket and the guy?”
 Every idea that I’m coming up with is ending worse.
 Finally, I accept it.
 I jump in the shower.
 I get out.
 I get dressed.
 Security shows up.
 [imitates knocking]
 “Mr.
 Iglesias?”
 “Yeah.”
 “Ready?”
 “Yeah, yeah.
 Give me a second.”
 I grab my backpack.
 I put on my backpack.
 I walk over to the door, open up the door.
 “Let’s go.”
 He sees the gift basket on the chair, and he’s trying to be nice.
 “I’ll get that for you, sir.”
 “Uh– Yeah, bring it.
 Bring… Never know when you might need an application.”
 So now he’s escorting me out the back door of the theater into an empty parking lot on our way to the tour bus that’s at the very end of the parking lot.
 We’re walking for a good four minutes.
 All of a sudden, I hear this: “Fluffy! Whoo-ooh! Fluffy! Flu-Flu-Flu-Flu-Flu-Flu-Flu-Fluffy! Hoo-hoo, Fluffy!”
 I’m like, “Is he hog-calling me?”
 “I believe so, sir.”
 It’s the guy that gave me the gift basket, and now he’s standing next to the tour bus.
 So there’s no way I’m gonna get past him.
 So I’m like, “Man!”
 So we stop walking.
 Security’s like, “Would you like me to call for backup?”
 “You don’t need to.
 He’s not gonna hurt me.
 It’s just gonna get really weird.”
 I pull out my cell phone, and I’m trying to text Martin.
 “Come on, Martin.
 Get over–” He’s not replying.
 The guy gets tired of waiting next to the bus.
 So now he’s walking towards me, but he’s doing it in a really weird way.
 He’s walking towards me like I’m a dangerous animal.
 Okay? He’s doing this: “Fluffy.
 Fluffy.”
 “I’m not gonna do anything!”
 And he walks over, and he’s just ranting.
 “All right, look here, Fluffster.
 First and foremost, let me just tell you something right now.
 I’ve been watching your comedy for about seven years now, and my favorite joke that you tell is when you give that gift basket to your colored friend G.
 Man, first time I heard you tell that joke, I wanted to laugh really hard, but I couldn’t, right? ’Cause I was at a bar sitting next to two black people.
 You can’t laugh at a black joke in front of black people ’cause they get all uppity, start chanting civil rights and Rosa Parks and shit like that.
 And, hey, I voted for Obama, but it’s too soon to laugh.
 You know what I’m sayin’? Anyway, I took my happy ass home, and I got on the Internet, and I Googled ‘Racist Gift Basket,’ and your joke came up, and I had me a good old laugh, and I says, ‘You know, I love Fluffy’s sense of humor.
 He likes to push the envelope with his friends, and he doesn’t allow political correctness to interfere with a good friendship.
 At the end of the day, you’re still friends, you still love each other, you still respect one another.
’ I said, ‘Hey, if the Fluffster ever shows his ass here in Mobile, be first in line to get me one of them tickets.
’ And you came! So I tell my friends, ‘Let’s go! Let’s go see the Fluffster.
’ I said, ‘But first, I’d bet you anything he’d appreciate it if somebody were to get him one of them gift baskets like he got G.
’ Except we got you the UPS basket.”

 “The problem is you didn’t laugh.
 You got offended, and I didn’t want you to get offended, Fluffster.
 I wanted you to laugh.
 But the problem is, is that, you know, I didn’t need you thinking that Mobile was a horrible place and we were horrible people.
 We were just trying to have fun with you the same way you had fun with G.
 We work very hard here, 40-plus hours a week myself.
 And the amount of money and time that we put into that gift basket is only because we love you.
 Hey, you have any idea how long I was on the goddamn Internet trying to find an application for US citizenship? In English? Are you shitting me? Everything’s in español.
 Hey, I voted for Obama.
 I ain’t got time for that.
 The bottom line is that I’m sorry for interfering with your performance.
 It’ll never happen again.
 I just wanted to say I’m sorry, and hopefully you’ll allow me to take a picture with you.
 I’m sorry.”
 And I was like, “Oh, my God, I’m a dick.”
 I said, “Listen, sir, you don’t have to apologize.
 I should apologize.
 I didn’t handle the situation the right way.
 But you gotta look at it through my eyes.
 I’ve never had anyone take an entire crowd away from me.”
 “That was pretty good, huh?”
 “Will you listen? Yes, that was pretty good.
 Look, I’m very sorry that I got upset.

 I won’t let that happen again.
 You don’t have to apologize.
 I will be happy to take a picture with you.”

 He’s looking for an app.

 Meanwhile, the guy wants to pose with his arm over my shoulders.
 He’s a little shorter than me, so I gotta do this one right here, okay? He’s got me in this headlock, and he just starts talking.
 “Look here, Fluffster.
 Let me just tell you something right now.
 I really appreciate what you do.
 I’m gonna continue to pray for you, your family, your friends and your success because what you do is a godsend.
 It really is.
 In these times, you make people smile, you make people laugh.

 I’m not on a diet, and it’s funny because people go, Why then do you drink diet soda? So I can eat regular cake.

 I have them in the back.
 I really appreciate it.
 That was very nice of you.
 The management and the promoters are freaking out there, like, Gabriel, why do they all bring you cake? I go, Because on TV I talked about one time how much I love cake.
 And so people bring it.
 My friend Mondo got mad, He’s, like, [Mexican male accent]
 Why don’t you talk about hookers?Somebody asked me earlier too, they said, Gabriel, when you get to do your special, are you gonna do anything about the country, are you gonna talk about politics?

 But the last few times I had to say no because they put me on the radio with a guy who’s like “from” Mexico.

 My friend didn’t know when to draw the line and we were hanging out one day and sure enough a freakin’ cop got mad, (deep male voice) Oh, you think it’s real funny, huh? You think it’s easy to be a police officer? You see that scar? I got stabbed in ’92.
 See that? Bullet wound, ’96.

 I know, fool, but it was funny, huh?And speaking of that, I get pulled over by a cop one night, two minutes after coming out of a Krispy Kreme drive-thru.
 Alright? Don’t get ahead of me, watch, I made a left turn instead of making a right but I wasn’t paying attention ’cause I had a box, I was, like, [gasp]
 Oh, you’re gonna get it when you get home! Oh, you’ve been so bad.

 I grab my box, I put it on my lap, I flipped it open, right? And–[mmmm]

 [mmm]
 [high-pitched screeches]
 Oh, I was gonna get nasty.
 And just as I was about to tear it up, the cop gets to the window and says the same thing that they all say, right? [deep male voice]
 You know why I stopped you? It was too easy.
 I looked at him and I said, ‘Cause you can smell it.
 Oh, he was dying, [deep male]

 Took a road trip from LA to Phoenix to go perform at this club.
 Let me tell you who was in the car.
 I’m driving, I got my buddy Armando riding shotgun.
 He’s another Fluffy guy, we call him Sexy Bitch.
 Well, I don’t call him that, his wife calls him that.

 He’s a sexy bitch! Anyway, in the back seat I got my friend, Martin.
 Next to him is my friend, Felipe.
 So we take off– [rrr]
 we’re on the 10 freeway, we’re passing all these Indian casinos– [rrr]

 Sorry, we’re stupid like that.
 Anyway, all of a sudden all these cars start passing me.

 I’m getting annoyed ’cause I’m driving a [loud truck horn]

 I said, Next car that tries to pass me, I’m not gonna let ’em.
 So I’m looking in the rear view mirror, waiting, looking, waiting, waiting, and I see a silver dot.
 The silver dot turned out to be a little car with two hoochies in it.
 Some of you guys are going, How do you know they’re hoochies? ‘Cause my friend Martin was in the back seat going, I feel a disturbance in the force.
 They try to go around and I cut ’em off.

 I don’t care if I get a ticket, but as long as he doesn’t take the car.
 Mondo, be silly, crack a joke.
 Martin, be funny.
 Felipe.

 What, fool? Shut the hell up! So the cop comes back to the car, What the hell were you doing out there? Before I could think of something funny to say, from the back seat I hear, “Fool, he was testing the suspension.”
 Oh, my God.
 This pothead’s gonna get me arrested.
 Officer, I’m sorry, that’s my friend, Felipe, that’s the guy from the special, the guy who says “But it was funny, huh?”
 He’s just trying to get me in trouble.
 I’m really sorry.
 Whatever.
 So he goes back to his squad car with my driver’s license, and he’s swiping it in a computer.

 I told my buddy Mondo, Give me my CDs.
 I take out my Bad Boys II soundtrack, and I pop it in, track three is the theme song to Cops.
 I tell my friend, Felipe, Tell me when the cop starts walking.
 Okay, fool, here he comes.
 I crank that song as loud as I could.
 [static and beep]
 Ha! Bad boys, what you, what you, what you gonna do.
 [imitates beat music]

 Even better than that, the two hoochies in the car can hear the music and they’re freakin’ out.
 They’re, like, [high-pitched]
 Oh my God, we’re gonna be on TV! The cop goes to the girls, gives them a ticket, lets them go.

 The cop is in the middle of the freeway, dying.

 He walks over to the window and he’s like, Shut it off! [screech]
 [click]
 Yes, sir.
 Hands me my license and the registration, and he tells me, Gabriel, I want you to do me a big favor, I want you to keep this tank under a hundred.
 You think you can do that? Uh-huh.
 Do that for me, keep on doing what you do, and you have yourself a nice day.

 I needed that the first time I– well, never mind.
 They want to ask you some questions, uh, Who we got first? This is a little different something we decided to do because there’s gonna be a DVD release with special features we figured why not, sometimes people do things and sometimes people wanna know information and rather than go on the Internet, you can ask the source.
 So, here’s you guys’ opportunity, anything you guys wanna ask me, go for it.
 What’s your name, homey? My name is Danny.
 Where you from? Visalia, California.
 Visalia in the house! Go ahead, Danny.
 This past summer I got on a rollercoaster, when I sat down, it went click, click, click.
 How many’d you get? Dude, I’m beyond clicks now.
 I don’t even get on.
 Like six years ago, bro, I could still go to Disneyland, and lean on–[grrr]

 Now, I’m older, I hang out by the strollers.

 Thank you, man.
 What I was curious about is how you come up with your material.
 How do I come up with material? Uh, some people have writers, some comics are writers, I don’t know how to sit down and come up with funny stuff and then come out here and try to perform it.
 I usually react to things that are happening, like people getting up, walking to the bathroom, baboso.
 And it’s still the same guy, too.
 Things happen to me on a daily basis, and I find a way to make them funny, like, for example, sometimes at night, when I go to a drive-thru and they mess me up, I like to go back in line again, and mess with them.
 Like when they come on the speaker, Welcome to McDonaId’.

 How are you handling success? How am I handling it? I’ll let you know when this airs.
 I’ll let you know when the DVDs come out to see if I hang [unintelligible]
.
 Honestly, bro, I don’t know how you would say how you’re handling it, I don’t forget where I’m from, that’s exactly why I wanted to do the special here because it was a– 1 0 years later type of thing.
 I still have my original best friend from way back in the day when I didn’t have comedy.
 When I would go spend Christmas at his house.
 And I have people that love me and care about me whether this happens or doesn’t happen.
 My brother will still let me sleep on his porch.
 So, it’s going good, man.
 Stay true to your roots.
 Thank you, bro.
 Ladies and gentlemen, this is a guy by the name of Fast Freddy.

 My friends came up to me, Hey, you’re Curious George, huh, bro? Come here! So I was just watching the movie of exorcism of Emily Rose.
 Have you seen that movie? That’s a scary movie, man, because the devil could just pop into you at any time.
 I didn’t know he could do that.
 You know, she was just walking down the street, How you doin’? [groans]
 That guy stayed with her, (deep male voice) Honey, I love you, I don’t care! [groan]

 Moped sucks, they have like no power.
 I couldn’t go over a speed bump– [imitates small motor]
 So I just got a little dog.
 I haven’t named it yet.
 I like the way white people name their pets.
 You name them after real people, like, this is my dog, Benjamin.
 Hi, Benji.
 Latinos we don’t really care what we name our pet, we’ll name it after any object.
 I went over my cousin’s house, he says I brought a neat dog.
