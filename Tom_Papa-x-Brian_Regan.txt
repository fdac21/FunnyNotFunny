 We play tennis.
 She beats me every time.
 A couple of weeks ago, I beat her for the first time, she didn’t say anything, I thought that was weird.
 I didn’t wanna say something, “I beat you!”
 It’s okay.

Tennis is weird.
 The scoring system per game in tennis is mathematically ludicrous.
 It doesn’t make even a little bit of sense.
 First of all, there’s no zero.
 If you don’t have any points, you have to say “love.”
 If you don’t say it like that, your opponent gets upset.
 -“How many points you have, Brian?”
 -“Um, I think you know.
 I’ve never touched the ball ever.
 I have zero.”
 “You have love.”

 Be careful.


That’s the smart part of the scoring system.
 If you get your first shot in, he’ll go, “You got 15.”
 “No, that’s not possible.
 We just arrived.”
 You get the next shot in, you get another 15, to a total of 30.
 “Oh, okay.
 I got it.
 Say no more.”
 But you get the next shot in, you get ten points… to a total of 40.
 No explanation as to why this ratio… is any different from the first two volleys.
 Ten, so say the random gods.
----Punchline----
 I award ten at this juncture for no apparent reason.

 He thinks little numbers is better than all that.”


Another thing I don’t like about tennis.
 Why are you allowed two tries for every single serve? You get a mulligan every serve? “Give me the ball back, I hit it into the net.
 Give me the ball.”
 “I get a point?”
 “No, we’re playing the most lenient game in the history of sports.
 I can make error after error after error after error and still be in this game.
 Give me the ball.
 Give me the ball.”
 The hell? Can you imagine seeing that in other sports? A quarterback looking at a defensive back with a football? “Give me the ball back.
 Where do you think you’re going with that? Bring me the ball back.
 I did not wanna throw that interception.
 [yelling]
 Give me the ball back.
 Give me the ball back.”
 So, why in tennis do they allow that? That encourages people who play three times in their whole life.
 They know every first shot is a freebie, so they try to land some rocket… that don’t have a chance in hell of ever touching down on the planet Earth.
 [mimics ball bouncing]

 Say they make a catch in the end zone and yell, “That’s what I’m talking about.”
 They should whip out an iPad.
 “In fact, this is me from an interview just last evening.”
 “Tomorrow, it’s gonna be important for us to get into field position.
 The defensive back on me is one of the best players in the league.
 It’ll be challenging for me to get open.
 In the last two minutes, I’ll make a nice head fake, get open in the end zone.
 Throw will not be good.
 I’ll have to grab it, keep my feet in balance to make the go-ahead touchdown.”

My dad likes that awkward moment comedy… when not everybody gets it.
 I like everybody in the lasso.
 My dad likes when there’s one man out.

 I drove my dad to the restaurant where we were meeting.
 He and I get out of the car.
 We’re walking in.
 He’s an old guy, doesn’t walk well.
 He’s shuffling along.
 I said, “Dad, you need help?”
 He goes, “I got it.”

 Are we the smartest species? We’re– We’re top of the food chain? I so wish while he was yelling that a clamp would have descended… from the darkness of the ceiling, like one of those claw games, just right above him, and then just clamped onto his ribs, and just pulled him up, a-whooping and a-hollering, a-legs a-flailing, just pulled him up into the darkness.
 I don’t want him to die.
----Punchline----
 I just never wanna see him again.

 You’re not allowed to sit in the car without some harness system holding you in, but they’ll let you sit on a motorcycle like this? Good luck! So, he tears away, and I’m like: [screams]
 I use every ounce of gut muscle I have to work my way back up.
 He’s starts herking and jerking, our helmets started clicking.

 He was like 17 at the time.
 And there was Pat and Dennis and then me.
 I was like 9.
 I’m in the back.

 So, I was like, “Mike, I know you wanna get home quickly, and I don’t know how to tell you, but I have to pee.”
 He goes, “That’s tough, ain’t it, Brian?”
 “Yeah.”
 I never got that reaction out of Mom or Dad.
 “Oh, we got a new driver.
 It’s tough.”
 I said, “Mike, I’m serious.
 I have to pee.”
