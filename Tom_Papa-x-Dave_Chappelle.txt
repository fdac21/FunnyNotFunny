 You notice that?[sighs]
 This is a fucking weird time.
Mhmm.
In like 1993, I’m not sure what year it was, but I was in LA.
 I had smoked a joint and I was watching a movie, Apocalypse Now.
 It was like just after 4:00 in the morning.
 And what later would become the known Northridge earthquake happened.
 It felt like it started in my apartment.
You know? I’m from east of the Mississippi.
 On this side we don’t know what earthquakes are about.
 I got to tell you something, man [burps]
Excuse me, burping.
This shit was terrifying.
 It was absolutely terrifying.
Uh, a lot of things went through my mind, I was like, not naked, but you know what I mean, just chilling in my boxers.
 Uh, I put my clothes on, I found my weed.
 And some, a pipe, and a lighter and some money, and my keys, all these things, while the earthquake is happening, while I’m experiencing what an earthquake is for the first time, and I was certain that I might very possibly die.
 As a matter of fact, I remember I made a point not to scream, just in case I lived, I wouldn’t have to remember myself being vocally terrified.
 But I forgave myself for being terrified.
 That earthquake couldn’t have been more than 35 seconds.
 This man kneeled on a man’s neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds! Can you imagine that!? This kid thought he was going to die.
 He knew he was going to die.
 He called for his mother.
 He called for his dead mother.
 I’ve only seen that once before in my life, my father, on his deathbed, called for his grandmother.
 When I watched that tape I understood this man knew he was going to die.
 People watched it, people filmed it, and for some reason, that I still don’t understand, all these fucking police had their hands in their pockets.
Who.
 Are.
 You.
 Talking.
 To!What are you signifying? That you can kneel on a man’s neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds and feel like you wouldn’t get the wrath of God.
 That’s what is happening right now.
   It’s not for a single cop, it’s for all of it.
 Fucking all of it.
 I don’t mean to get heavy, but.

 I didn’t watch the tape for a week.
 I didn’t watch it.
 I knew.
 I saw a still picture, I said, I don’t want to see this, because I can’t unsee it.
 But when I finally watched it, I understood, nobody’s going home.
 Anyone who sees this, well they’re going to be furious.

 I was born at 8:46 in the morning.

 Dylann Roof.
 Dylann Roof killed eight people in a church in Charleston, South Carolina.
 He prayed with them first, and then he shot them at point-blank range.
It goes on and on.
 And in one weekend a law abiding citizen right here in Beaver Creek is murdered.
 The cop that murdered John Crawford pulled me over the night before and let me off with a warning.
 And the next day, kills a kid.
 He says, drop the weapon, bang bang bang.
This kid didn’t even have enough time to register that he was the one being spoken to.
This is our home town.
 It happened right here.
 I was very proud to be your neighbor, I love the way you guys hit those streets.
 We said his name and we tried to make sure everyone remembered him but he got lost in the sauce.
 And this guy John Crawford was a saint.
 He was there buying shit so him and his kids could make s’mores.
Michael Brown got shot the same week, and Michael Brown became the story.
And then, am I boring you?Well then, right back in Minneapolis was Philando Castile.
 Law abiding citizen, was a registered gun carrier, was trying to show police the paperwork for his registered weapon and was murdered in front of his wife and his child and then right in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, just two days later it happens again.
 And what do you think is going to happen? Three days later nine cops get murdered in Dallas at a Black Lives Matter rally.
Wow, I’ll never forget it.
 It was the first time I ever thought, I gotta get my family the fuck out of this place.
 These niggas will never understand.
 I’m tired of explaining to these people something that’s so goddamn obvious.
The guy that killed those nine cops, just like Chris Dorner before him, was from our military.
And then right after he did it, another four cops were shot dead in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Again, a Black man, that served in our military.
 What are they doing? Why would our guys do that?Black people from the military? Because they believe, just like they did when they were joining the fucking military, that they were fighting acts of terror.
   These are our people.
 These are our countrymen.
If I were white, and saw one of these men get murdered and I was in the NRA why wouldn’t I stand up for them.
 A card carrying legal gun owner that gets murdered in cold blood?Because he’s Black.
That’s why they don’t give a fuck.
There’s only one time the NRA ever supported an assault weapon ban.

Slavery is a really wild concept.
Uh, it’s some weird shit.
The night that those nine police officers were killed felt like the end of the world.
The only reason it wasn’t the end of the world, in my opinion, was because at the very same time that was happening, Kobe Bryant was playing his last game as an LA Laker.
 And as scary as all that shit was, I kept flipping back to see if Kobe would drop sixty, and he did.
 Oh, and he did.
And vaguely in the back of my mind I remember the idiot ass bitch telling somebody to shut up and dribble, and I watched this nigga dribbling and saving this goddamn country from itself.
 I loved Kobe Bryant.
 He died the night, the day I won a GRAMMY, he died.
That’s why I didn’t show up at the GRAMMYs.
 Because Kobe died.
 They had both of his fucking jersey numbers hanging up.
 8, 24.
 Well, that’s my birthday.
I cried like a baby.

So, here’s what I said on Saturday Night Live that I got completely wrong:At the end of my set I talked about how few Black people were invited to the White House.
How Frederick Douglass was the first.
 And that it didn’t happen again until Roosevelt.
But that was wrong.
 It happened one other time before that.
 Woodrow Wilson.
 Woodrow Wilson received delegation of African Americans at the White House.
 They were from South Carolina.
 There was a man who was lynched for a $30 dispute at a grain elevator and they killed him because the nigga was rich, and they hated him for being more welathy then they were, and they murdered him.
 And the people in South Carolina said, fuck that, and they went via the governor of South Carolina, it was a Black delegation that was facilitated to meet with Woodrow Wilson.
 That delegation was lead by the AME Bishop William David Chappelle.
That’s where I get my name.

 I was thinking about a person I never actually met, but I heard about all my life.
 I was thinking about my great grandfather, who apparently, by all accounts, was a very great man.
 He was born a slave in South Carolina.
 Was a slave for ten years of his life.
 And when the northerners came down, they started educating some of the newly freed black children, and he learned how to read.
 Got enamored with education and dedicated his life to three things: Education, freedom of black people, Jesus Christ.
 Became a juggernaut in the AME Church.
 It was a pretty amazing story my great grandfather had, and I thought about him all day today because I wish I could see him now.
 And I wish he could see me, because I wonder what he would say.
 This week I flew to New York on a private jet to host the Saturday Night Live.
 Netflix started streaming a show that bears his name, The Chappelle Show.
 And HBO Max is streaming it.
----Punchline----
 And I didn’t get paid for any of it.
----Tagline(s)----
 Yeah, if he could see me now he’d probably be like, “this nigga got bought and sold more than I have.”

 Please remember that.
 Remember that for the first time in the history of America, the life expectancy of white people is dropping.
 Because of heroin, because of suicide.
 All these white people out there that feel that anguish, that pain, they are mad because they think nobody cares, and maybe they don’t.
 Let me tell you something.
 I know how that feels.
 I promise you, I know how that feels.
 If you’re a police officer, and every time you put your uniform on, you feel like you’ve got a target on your back, you’re appalled by the ingratitude that people have when you would risk your life to save them — Oh, man, believe me, believe me, I know how that feels.
 Everyone knows how that feels.
 But here’s the difference between me and you.
 You guys hate each other for that.
 And I don’t hate anybody.
 I just hate that feeling.
 That’s what I fight through.
 That’s what I suggest you fight through.
 You got to find a way to live your life.
 You got to find a way to forgive each other.
 You got to find a way to find joy in your existence in spite of that feeling.

 I had to quarantine for ten days at least.
 They said “You’re gonna have to stay in the room,” I didn’t go nowhere.
 And it started making me nuts, ’cause I would just sit in the room and watch videos all day.
 Now, do you know what I was watching? And I hate to say this, but there was a lot of videos sadly, of Black people… beating up Asians for no reason.
 These attacks were unprovoked, I couldn’t believe it.
 And I was sitting in the room watching this shit, it would stress me out.
 I was stressed already because the whole time when you get coronavirus, at least the first five days you wait, and see how sick you’re gonna get.

 Sounds dumb, but hear me out.
 In my movie idea we find out that these aliens are originally from Earth.
 That they are from an ancient civilization that achieved interstellar travel and left the Earth thousands of years ago.
 Some other planet that they go to and things go terrible for them in the other planet so they come back to Earth and decide that they want to claim the Earth for their very own.

 It is coming out soon.
 The book is designed to help parents, teach their children about racism which, if you’re a parent you know is an impossible concept to teach to a child.
 But I’m doing it.
 The book is about a big, strong beautiful Black man with a benign, regular-ass White name… and he has a White speaking voice.
----Punchline----
 So whenever this motherfucker calls to get a reservation at a restaurant, oh, he gets the reservation.

 And I said, “Oh my God, you are a woman.”
 This is too much for me to even wrap my mind around but I tell you what, I un-balled my fist immediately and I softened my posture so that she would know, she is in no danger.
 I even changed the tone of my voice.
----Punchline----
 I said softly, sweetly, like a pimp might say.

 She dropped that foot back, she was in a perfect southpaw stance.

 She threw a wild hook at me and I saw it coming from yesterday, so I slipped it like this… I had no choice, I had to go to work.
 I let that jab go, you should have seen me go nigga.

   If I had a strip club in Yellow Springs, I would have called that shit “Strippies.”
 All naked hippies, all the time.
 And I would only hire girls with long titties and long vagina head that looks like they slept on it.
 And I would keep a pile of dirt, right next to the stage.
 I’d come up like, “Bitch get your feet in that dirt and get up there and give those people what they came to see.”
 “Chalk up, bitch.”
 Couple of years ago I was in Ohio, at a shopping mall.
 An old White lady… This is true, she was following me around the mall.
 Which sounds paranoid, but I’m sure she was following me.
 Mean lady too.
 You ever see a woman with lines on her face? That just tell you like… even if she’s smiling, it would look like it would hurt the muscles in her face.
 I knew she was following me, ’cause she was at places that had nothing to do with her I’d be looking around like, “What is this old bitch doing in Gamestop and Footlocker and all the places I like to go?”
 Every time I see her, she’d just be looking mean on me.
 And eventually I forgot about it.
 So, then after, I am shopping I go all the way to the back of the parking lot, I’m parked all the way in the back and as soon as I open my car door I hear a voice go, “David Chappelle.”
 Just like that.
 I didn’t even have to look, I knew it was her.
 And I looked back and sure enough there she was, that face.
 To be honest with you, she probably wasn’t even that old.
 She’s probably around my age.
----Punchline----
 But she was a White woman, this bitch looked terrible.

 Webster’s defines a feminist as a human being, not a woman, a human being, that believes in equal rights for women.

 But remember, they were free when they found out.
 They just didn’t know it yet.
 Very interesting holiday.
 You know, I learned something This is a wild story.
 I learned this past Juneteenth of a story, this is true.
 And it’s that there was a Black man who was in South Carolina during slavery who somehow got granted his freedom by his so-called master.
 And when his master granted him the freedom he also gave him a plot of land.
 Now it turns out, this brother was brilliant.
 He had a good eye, good knack for farming.
 And he farmed this plot of land very successfully and made a lot of money, and this is where the story gets crazy.

This does not mean that I feel like another point of view can’t exist.
 I was doing a night club in Oakland, 16 years ago and this was the first time that the trans community ever got mad at me that I knew about.
 And then I was nobody, I had just quit Chappelle Show.
 It was like a nothing hole in the wall club and I was doing some transgender jokes in Oakland, it was 16 years ago.
 My pronoun game was not as nice as it is today.
 I went too far, I said things like tranny and shit I didn’t know these words were bad, and a woman stood up and just gave me the business.
 Started screaming at me, and I’m sure it was a woman.
 But she kept calling me transphobic and all this shit I had never even heard these words before, it was really weird.
----Punchline----
 I didn’t trip, I just gazed at Security to look like, “Go on, get that bitch out of here.”

I kept it moving.
 And then she went to the press.
 The next day one of the gay papers wrote all of the same things she had said to me, about me in the paper.
 Misquoted the jokes, and was calling me transphobic you know, these words, I had never heard them before but every time that I talked with anybody from the community since they always repeat the talking points from that article.
 My least favorite of which being, I hate this phrase they say, “I was punching down on them.”
 “Punching down”, what the fuck does that mean? Now fast forward.
 It is 2019.
 And I am in a restaurant in Ohio, very nice restaurant.
 It’s Thanksgiving week.
----Punchline----
 And to be honest, it is not a very nice restaurant, but it is a nice restaurant, if you’re a White person from Ohio that has never been anywhere before.

I’m sitting in the bar, I’m having a drink by myself and the only other person in the bar is a woman, a couple of stools down.
 And she was alone, and she was older, and that made me feel sad, ’cause it was the holidays.
 So, I told the bartender, “Send that woman a drink on me.”
 Just trying to spread the cheer, and I wish I didn’t.
 This woman wanted to talk.
 She wasn’t mean, she was nice, but she just wanted to talk about shit that you know, I mean a nigga just trying to get drunk don’t want to hear about this bitch remodeling in her bathroom.
 And I’m sitting there, trying to be polite.
 Oh, subway tiles? Word.
 But then she hits a lick.
 Piqued my interest.
 She says, “My daughter is coming home for the holidays.”
 Like, “Oh, that is great news, I’m glad you’re not going to be alone.”
 And then she goes on and on about how great her daughter is.
 I guess her daughter got a new agent and she is out in Hollywood, she’s in movies and on television and all this stuff and as she’s telling me this, I’m thinking, this woman is so sweet.
 She probably doesn’t even know who I am.
----Punchline----
 Or what I do for a living because I know what your daughter’s is out in Hollywood doing.

 And I grab the picture and this is all I say, this is all I say, “Oh… she is very beautiful.”
 And as she puts the picture away she… looks mean all of a sudden, like she caught me in some kind of trap.
 “What did that face mean?”
 And then she goes, “She’s transgender.”

 Is that a dude? Is your daughter a man?”
 Can’t say that shit.
 It’s really annoying.

 It’s the Wednesday… before the Thursday that’s Thanksgiving, and I’m in a totally different bar and this bar, trust me, is not a nice place.

 I could not dislike somebody that felt that way about me.
 We became fast friends.
 And when I made that special Sticks and Stones right as it was coming out, I happened to be in San Francisco and I wanted to do a show.
 But I needed an opening act, and I remembered… that trans woman I had met, so I called her on the phone.

 Any other comedian I’ve ever seen, if they had bombed as bad as she did, would have snuck out of the back of the theatre and went home and cried or something, but she didn’t do that.
 Not only did she not leave, she found a seat, right up in front.

She was drunk.
 So she starts talking to me, while I’m onstage but the way a person would talk to a television when they were alone.
 She was talking to me like that.
 That didn’t bother me ’cause I knew her.
 But the crowd didn’t like that shit at all ’cause she sucked.
 And a guy in the back of the room stood up and Daphne’s hair was dyed blonde at the time and the guy screamed out, and his energy felt wild as fuck.
 He said, “Hey Daphne!”
 and everybody got clamped, they got tense.
----Punchline----
 We didn’t know who was a heckler or active shooter, and…

Boy, when she said that shit, it blew the roof of the place.
 Cut through all the tension, with that one joke.
 She had made up for 45 minutes of a stinker of a show.
 And after that, she could do no wrong.
 And I kept on rocking, and she kept on talking to me.
 And then the show became something cooler than a show.
 It became like a conversation between a Black man and a White trans woman and we started getting to the bottom of shit.
 All of them questions that you think about that you’d be afraid to ask, I was just asking them and she was answering them and her answers were funny as shit.
 The crowd was falling out of their chairs and at the end of the show, I go, “Well, Daphne”… I said “Well, that was fun.”
 I go, “I love you to death, but I have no fuckin’ idea what you’re talking about.”
 The whole crow laughed except for Daphne.
 Man, she looks at me like I’m not her friend anymore.
 Like I’m something bigger than me, like I’m the whole world in a guy.
 Then she said, “I don’t need you to understand me.”
 I said, “What?”
 She said, “I just need you to believe…” Just like that she goes, “…that I’m having a human experience.”
 And when she said it the whole crowd kind of gasped.
 And I gave the Fight Club look.

 Oh yeah, this is a true story, my heart was broken.
 Yeah, it wasn’t the jokes.
 I don’t know if was them dragging or I don’t know what was going on in her life but I bet dragging her didn’t help.
 I was very angry at them, I was very angry at her.
 I felt like Daphne lied to me.
 She always said, she identified as a woman.
 And then one day she goes up to the roof of her building and jumps off and kills herself.
 Clearly… only a man would do some gangster shit like that.

Don’t forget who I am.
 Don’t forget what I am.
 I am a black dude.
 And don’t ever forget how I got here.
 My ancestors were kidnapped.
 I don’t even know where the fuck I’m from.
 They were put on the bottom of boats.
 They sailed them across the Atlantic.
 Many of them died.
 Only the strongest survived.
 And once they got here, they beat the humanity out of my people.
 They turned us into beasts of burdens.
 They made us do their work, and the irony is, hundreds of years later they’re calling us lazy.
 We fought in the Civil War.
 We damn near freed ourselves.
 Then, with Reconstruction, black people did great.
 My great-grandfather was a very wealthy man.
 But then the Black Codes came, Jim Crow came, and it was a hundred years of unspeakable oppression again.
 Lynchings, all kinds of terroristic acts to keep us in the margins of society.
 Yet, we still fought.
 And Dr. King was born.
 And then, things got better.
 Twenty years after Dr. King was assassinated, Michael Jackson was moonwalking on television.
 Something, something, something.

 The cure for LA is in South Africa.
 You motherfuckers need truth and reconciliation with one another.
 Because the end of apartheid should have been a fucking bloodbath by any metric in human history, and it wasn’t.
 The only reason it wasn’t is because Desmond Tutu and Mandela and all these guys figured out that if a system is corrupt, then the people who adhere to the system and are incentivized by that system are not criminals.
 They are victims, and the system itself must be tried, but because of how systems work is so compartmentalized as far as information , the only way we can figure out what the system is is if everybody says what they did.
 Tell him how you participated.

 A lot of black dudes haven’t been getting “me too-ed.”
 I don’t want to jinx myself.
 You know why, though? Obviously, black women go through the same thing, right? The reason is because black women from slavery won’t tell on us.
 Because they know that no matter how bad we black dudes are, white dudes are very mean.
 They’re scared to see us get punished.

 Man, I know nothing about being a woman, but I know fear.
 Yo, I used to live in New York when I was 17.
 I couldn’t even pay my bills.
 You know what I did to make money? I used to do shows for drug dealers that wanted to clean their money up.
 One time I did a real good set, and these motherfuckers called me in the back room.
 They gave me $25,000 in cash.
 I was probably 18, 19 years old.
 I was scared.
 I thanked them profusely, I put that money in my backpack, I jumped on the subway and started heading towards Brooklyn at one in the morning.
 Never been that terrified in my life.
 Because I’d never in my life had something that somebody else would want.
 I thought to myself, “Jesus Christ, if these motherfuckers knew how much money I had in this backpack, they’d kill me for it.”
 Then I thought, “Holy shit.

 It’s written by a guy named Iceberg Slim.
 Yeah, bring it up here.
 This is Matthew.
 Matthew’s from France.
 He’s white.
 And yet, he has an original copy of this book written by a black American who was a pimp in the ’40s.
 Iceberg Slim.
 His real name was Robert Beck.
 He got the name Iceberg because he was in a bar in Chicago, and there was a shootout in the bar, and a bullet went through this nigga’s hat, and he still finished his drink.
 Pimps love shit like that.
 They said, “Man, you’re ice cold.”
 And he said, “I like that.”
 And it stuck.
----Punchline----
This book is so heavy in the front and has a glossary of pimp terms, because the ideas are so foreign to the American ears.

 Of course you don’t.
 Mileage on a ho is a very wild concept.
 It means that pimps understand there’s a finite amount of bad shit a person can do before they lose their fucking mind.
 And a good pimp can look at a woman that he’s never seen before and call it.
 She’s good for 500 fucks.
 That’s her mileage.
 Anything over that, that bitch is gonna spill.
 They do it to you.

 That’s right.

Iceberg Slim breaks down some of the coldest capitalist concepts I’ve ever heard in my life.
 He describes in detail how these men break women so that they will give them the money that they make with their own bodies.
 There’s a story in here so cold, it makes me shudder to think about it.
 Iceberg Slim is trying to control the woman that he finds uncontrollable.
 So he asks an older pimp how he can rein her in.
 And the older pimp says, “Oh, that’s easy, Iceberg.
 All you have to do is beat that bitch with a coat hanger.
 And then run her a bath.
 And give her some pills.
 She’ll be so grateful that you fixed her, that she’ll forget you were the motherfucker that beat her in the first place.”
 That’s some cold shit.
Now.
 At the end of this book, Iceberg Slim tells a story.
 It’s kind of the crescendo of the book.
 And in the story, Iceberg Slim’s bottom bitch is at the end of her mileage.
----Punchline----

 But she didn’t know that.
 She didn’t know how important she was.
 So what he did was, he called her to ignite her.
 He said, “Look, bitch, you and I got to part ways.”
 She said, “Fine, motherfucker, I don’t need you anyway, because I know somebody at Ringling Brothers.”

 He’s waiting for you in room number seven.
 I want you to go over there and fuck him.
 But before you do, I need to put some of this stuff in his drink.
 And then he’s gonna fall asleep.

And she runs up the motel steps and disappears in room number seven.
 She’s gone for a real long time.
 Real long time.
 So long, in fact, that Iceberg got a little worried.
 But then, suddenly, she came back.
 [gasps]
 He says, “Where’s the briefcase?”
 She said, “I didn’t get it, Daddy.”
 “What do you mean you didn’t? What’s wrong with you?”
 She said, “I did everything you said, but that man didn’t look right.
 Something wrong, Daddy.”
 “What do you mean? Did you put that stuff in his drink?”
 “I did everything you said, Daddy.
 I put all of it in his drink.”
 He said, “Wait a minute, bitch, you put all of it in his drink?”
 Now he had to see for himself.
 So the two of them go to the motel, and they go into room number seven.
 And on the bed laying lifelessly is the white man that she was supposed to fuck.
 Iceberg said, “You right, bitch.
 He don’t look good.
 What the fuck?”
 So he called a friend of his that was a doctor that was close by.
 And the doctor came in, gave the guy a thorough examination and told them both what was obvious.
 “Slim, this motherfucker is dead.”
 “Oh, God, Daddy.
 Oh, no.
 Oh, no.
 We killed him!”
 He said, “Calm down, bitch.

 You killed this motherfucker.”
 And then he reached on the bed and he grabbed the briefcase.
 He popped it open.
 It was filled with money.
 More than any of them had ever seen.
 Iceberg took a little bit of the money and gave it to the doctor, and the doctor left discreetly.
 “All right, bitch, let me think.
 [sighs]
 I can fix this for you.
 I know somebody I can call.
 But if I call him, I’m gonna owe these motherfuckers a big favor.”
 “Oh, God, Daddy, please.
 I don’t want to go to jail.”
 “Neither do I, bitch, so you shut up.”


He picked up the phone.
 She heard him mumbling in the phone a little bit.
 He hung up the phone, and then she was pacing the room, and he was just standing there cool, and they were waiting and waiting, and then suddenly, a van pulled up downstairs.
 Two guys get out with a carpet.
 They walk upstairs, they roll that carpet out on the floor, they throw the body in the carpet.
 They roll that motherfucker up like a burrito, they pick that shit up, and they throw it in the back of the van.
 They come back up and Iceberg opens the briefcase again and gives them a little money.
 He says, “I’ll get in touch with you guys later.”
 They say, “You’re not going to get in touch with us, we’ll find you.”
 He said, “Whatever, nigga.”
 And they bounced.
 “Oh, God, Daddy.
 Oh, God.”
 He says, “Relax, bitch.
 Listen.
 We getting the fuck out of here.
 You go downstairs and you get the car.
 We gotta leave separately.”
 She went, she got the car.
 Iceberg grabbed that briefcase, waited a few minutes, looked out the window, and then he went down with her.
 They both got in the car, and they drove off.
 She was a blubbering mess.
 “Oh! Oh, we did all this shit!”
 He said, “I told you bitch.
 We didn’t do anything.”
 You killed the motherfucker, and I cleaned him up, and now we got us a secret.
 Okay? I know I’m not going to tell, bitch, is you?”
 “Oh, no, I ain’t gonna tell.”
 He said, “All right, baby, cool.
 I’m gonna need you to stay with me for a while till this shit cools down.”
 She goes, “Okay, okay.
 Okay.”
 That’s the game.
That’s how the whole shit works, ladies.
 You understand? This bitch was at the end of her mileage.
 She was at for 498, she ended up tricking for Iceberg for another six months.
 She must have turned another 200 tricks for him.
 Do you understand? That’s some cold shit.
 And the cold shit about it is that the dead guy on the bed wasn’t even dead at all.
 This motherfucker was just a friend of Iceberg’s acting like he’s asleep.
 The doctor wasn’t a doctor.
----Punchline----
 He was a motherfucking butcher that happened to have a white coat.

 I was in Santa Fe the other night, and a motherfucker threw a banana peel at me.
 Yeah, that didn’t feel so good.
 Of course, it was a white person.
 Not to indict the whites.
 I’m just saying.
 Not to profile.
 And then, not only did he throw a banana peel at me, but… it was premeditated.
 You could tell.
 You could tell.
 The peel was too brown.
 You know what I mean? You didn’t eat that banana recently, motherfucker.
 You had that shit waiting on me.

Oh, I didn’t know you would ever clap for that.
 Well, all right.
 That’s the first time that shit’s ever happened.
 “Ohio?!”
 Anyway… I live amongst the whites.
 Small town in Ohio.
 And it was wintertime, and it had snowed recently, so there’s huge snowdrifts on the street.
 I was walking with my sister.
 Now, my sister was dressed in all Muslim garb, as were her children, and I was dressed as Dave Chappelle.
 And we were walking and just talking about something, and a car sped around the corner, and the window came down, and somebody threw a snowball and hit me right in my shoulder.
 [thud]
 I didn’t know what was going on.
 Why was this happening? Because I’m black? Because she’s Muslim? Because I’m Dave Chappelle? I couldn’t tell.
 But, again, I knew it was premeditated.
 Because who the fuck has a snowball in a warm car? But he didn’t think it all the way through, lady.
 Because he went around the corner and got stopped at a red light.
 He was caught in the traffic.
 So, I ran out into the street, and I just tapped on his window.
 [thumping]
 “My man, could I just talk to you guys for a second? Come on out for one second.
 I just want to talk to you.”
 There’s four young white dudes in the car.
 They’re like, “Just chill, bro.”
 I said, “Relax.
 I just want to talk.”
 Now, this is an old black trick.
 Really, I didn’t want to talk.
 I was gonna fuck ’em up.
 So, if you’re ever caught in traffic, and a black guy starts saying he just wants to talk to you, don’t open the door.
 Even if he’s me, smiling at you.
And they were like, “Chill, bro.
 Just chill.”
 And the one guy in the back seat— I don’t know what, he was just cockier than his friends.
 He was like, “Fuck it, man! I’ll get out the car!”
 And I started yanking on his door.
 “Let me help you, motherfucker.
 Let me just help you out.”
 And I didn’t notice his window was down.
 And he threw a snowball, that shit hit me right in my chest.
 Pow! He said, “Fuck you, you fucking nigger!”
 And then the light turned green and they sped off.
 And I smiled from ear to ear.
 I looked at my sister, and she said, “I got the plates.”
 And I was happy as shit because throwing a snowball at a motherfucker is a misdemeanor assault.
 But if you call him a nigger when you do it, that’s a felony hate crime.
 And me and my sister start dancing.
 “We’re gonna send this motherfucker to jail!”
I didn’t notice it, but while I was yelling at him, a crowd of all-white people had formed, ’cause it was an all-white town.
 And I was like, “Uh-oh.”
 I thought I was gonna get jumped.
 Then one of them white guys stepped up and was like, “I didn’t like that at all.
 This is not what this town represents.
 I don’t want this goddamn stuff in my vicinity.”
 And another white guy was like, “Yeah! I didn’t like it, either!”
 And then an old white guy stepped out of the crowd and said, “Young man, if you’re going to fill out a police report, I would like to come with you and do the same.”
 I said, “You guys would do that for me?”
 And the whole crowd said, “Hooray!”
 I said, “Come on, y’all!”
 I looked like Malcolm X going to see Brother Johnson with a trail of white people.
Unreal.
 An hour later, we were all sitting in the police station, and the police came in.
 They were like, “Well, Mr.
 Chappelle… sixteen identical police reports.
 We ran the tags.
 Two young men that had their mother’s car.
 We have all four suspects in holding, and the mother is here.
 It’s up to you.
 Whatever you want to do.
 If you want to press charges, we’ll move forward.
 Mr.
 Chappelle, are you okay?”
 “Huh? Sorry about that, Officer.
 I’m a little flustered.
 I’ve never been in a position where I could decide the fate of white children before.
 But… it’s weighing heavy on me, sir.
 And I really can’t decide.”
And I saw a lady pacing back and forth in the hallway, and I said, “Is that—” He goes, “Yes, that’s their mother.”
 “Can I speak to her before I make a decision?”
  And when the mom came in and she saw it was me, she busted out crying.
 “Oh, God.
 Oh, no.
 I don’t want him to go to jail.
 I am so sorry.
 I didn’t raise him to do this.
 We love your comedy.
 We love you at the house.”
 I said, “Miss, please, just— All right, look.
 I don’t necessarily want your son to go to jail, either.
 But what he did was pretty fucked up.
 So, is there something we can do, short of jail, just to let him know that he’s wrong?”
 She said, “I don’t know.
 What did you have in mind?”
 “Miss, I’ve never been in this position before.
 Oh, you know what we could do? I don’t know if I’m asking too much.
 But maybe if you— if you could just… suck my dick a little bit.
 Just a little bit.
 I’m not gonna finish.
 I just want you to do it enough so that I can tell him you did it.”
 I’m kidding.
 I’m kidding.
 I wouldn’t do that to anybody’s mother.
 Maybe my kid’s mom, but that’s it.
Ebola was in Texas.
 Ebola made a visit.
 Killed that man in Dallas.
 Five days, that man melted to death.
 What happened to the brother in Dallas? “Where was the secret serum?”
 is what we all said.
 I remember in the beginning of Ebola, there were two American doctors that got sick in Africa.
 They flew them in a private jet straight to Atlanta, to the CDC.
 I didn’t even know CDC saw patients.
 There it was said they administered what The New York Times called “a secret serum.”
 I don’t know what’s in it.
 It’s just like Colonel Sanders’ recipe.
 But both of these motherfuckers survived.
 These doctors, thank God, are healthy.
 They are out there somewhere tonight at Whole Foods, touching vegetables, walking around.
 Everything’s okay.
 “Hey, Frank.
 How are you?”
 “You didn’t hear? I had Ebola last week.
 But I’m doing all right now.
 I was bleeding out of my eyes and anus, so I got concerned, but I’m okay.”
What happened to the brother in Dallas? They just rubbed some Vicks on that nigga’s chest.
 “Good luck, little buddy.”
 I knew he wasn’t gonna make it.
 I remember.
Sad.
 I saw in The New York Times— they said Ebola is the new AIDS.
 Whew! Isn’t that something? Here I am, thinking that old AIDS was working just fine, and they already have a new AIDS out.
 Isn’t that amazing how they do that? Isn’t it weird how there’s a disease that just starts in 1980, and it doesn’t kill anybody but niggas, fags and junkies? Isn’t that a fucking amazing coincidence that this disease hates everybody that old, white people hate? I think either God is white, or the government hid that shit in disco balls.
 Only fun people get AIDS.
Last month, on the front of The New York Times, the measles was the headline.
 I had to check the date of the paper.
 I was like, “Measles? Is this 1850? What the fuck is this? Why is measles in the news?”

 It turns out they were trying to decide if mandatory vaccinations for children is the way we all want to go.

   You say yes? I’m sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
 I just— I don’t know.
 I don’t know about this one.
 First of all, black people generally don’t trust doctors.
 After the Tuskegee experiments and all that shit.
 More importantly, don’t forget Michael Jackson was killed by a doctor.
 Granted, he was doing drugs.
 But if I was a heroin addict and I had a licensed physician injecting heroin in me, I should survive that.
 I’d just be like, “I’m good, right? I’m good? It’s not too much, is it?”
 Dr.
 Butterfingers killed Michael Jackson.
 After that, I was like, “Fuck going to the doctor.”
Why the fuck am I getting my kids vaccinated for an old-ass disease like measles? You might as well give them a diarrhea shot if you’re so worried.
 Diarrhea has a bigger body count than the measles do.
 You know, diarrhea is funny today, but… a hundred years ago, if your ass had diarrhea, you were a goner.
 There was a zero chance of surviving.
 You get that first squirt.
 Pfft! Uh-oh.
 “Better start getting my affairs in order.
 I don’t have much time.
 It’s diarrhea.
 It’s very serious.”
 You just watch your buddy slowly die in a pool of his own shit.
 Pfft! “Oh.
 Oh.
 I give up, diarrhea.”
 Pfffft! “You’re too strong.”
 Pfft! Nowadays, your buddy would be like, “You got diarrhea? Just eat a banana, nigga.
 Drink some water.
 Let’s get to the club.
 We can still make last call.”
Tough time for the blacks.
 These are not good times for the blacks.
 You know what I’m talking about, right? Police are killing us again.
 It’s a very unfortunate set of circumstances, because we were doing very well.
 You know, America has a racial hot seat.
 I think we can all agree that’s the truth.
 And we can also agree that that hot seat is traditionally occupied by African-Americans in general, African-American men in particular.
 Although, I can see that, in recent years, that seat has been occupied by Mexicans… and I daresay Arabs.
 And we, the black Americans, would like to thank you both for your sacrifice and your struggle.
 We needed a break.
 We needed a goddamn break.
 We all go through something, but at least I can leave my backpack someplace.
 If you’re Arab and forget a backpack, you got about 20 minutes before they send that robot to blow your shit up.
 You can kiss all that Engineering homework good-bye, Fouhad.
Now ISIS is number one on the terrorist charts.
 And ISIS is fucking scary.
 ‘Cause if ISIS catches you, they’re going to cut your head off.
 That’s what they do.
 I’ve seen them do it on YouTube.
 It was fucking awful.
 He looked right into the camera and said, “Obama, I am back.”
 [swish]
 I saw that shit, I said, “Oh, my God.
 Don’t like.”
 How is this guy cutting people’s heads off on YouTube? I can’t even post a dick pic, and this motherfucker is decapitating people.
 I’m gonna have to change my settings.
You know, everyone has it hard.
 But I think, harder than black people and harder than Arabs and Mexicans, you know who has it the worst? Fat black people.
 It’s hard for white people to understand, but what I’m saying is very true.
 Fat black people have a really rough road, because all manner of things kill white people.
 But you know what kills more black people than anything, more than police and terrorism? Salt, nigga.
 Regular-ass table salt.
 Here, white people are getting Ebola cures and shit, and meanwhile, I’m dying from fucking flavoring.
Look, honestly, I’ll stop talking about it.
 Let me say this, though.
 Let me just say this.
 Can we all just say that we’ve seen it coming? Were you surprised? It’s like when that guy threw that banana at me.
 Do you think I was surprised? Hell no.
 I’ve been in show business 30 years.
 I was expecting this banana.
 I knew one of these nights— I was like, “Somebody’s gonna throw a banana at me one of these nights.”
‘Cause that’s how it starts, with the name-calling.
 Like that Paula Deen.
 Remember Paula Deen got fired from the Food Network? If you know anything about show business, it is really hard to get fired from the fucking Food Network.
 And they dropped that bitch like a hot potato.
 All because she called somebody an N-word 30 years before she had a show.
 I don’t know who she said it to, but whoever it was was just looking at her like, “I’m gonna get you for this, bitch.”
 That shit came back 30 years later like a Bill Cosby rape and sunk her battleship.
 And every black person was mad, but we weren’t that mad.
 It was more confusing than it was infuriating.
 I was just like, “Well, how is this bitch gonna call me a nigger when she taught me how to fry chicken? That’s not fair.”
I think Donald Sterling‘s shit was more serious.
 Remember Donald Sterling? He used to own the Clippers, and then he got caught on a secretly recorded tape saying some very unsavory things about African-Americans.
 And there’s a lesson in that for all of us.
 The lesson is if you are old and white and racist in this great country, whatever you do… don’t tell your black girlfriend about that shit.
 Because… that’s who made the tape.
 She recorded all that shit.
 And the tape was terrible.
 He was like, “Stop bringing black guys to my games.”
 At first, we were all confused.
 “How the fuck are you gonna have a game without us?”
But it turned out that the black guy he was speaking of was none other than Magic Johnson, the billionaire! Unbelievable.
 Never even mentioned the fact that he had AIDS, which is the first thing I would’ve said to my girlfriend.
 This guy must be really racist if AIDS is the footnote.
 “You gotta be careful, baby.
----Punchline----
 He got the old Ebola.”

 You can say what you want about that girl, but I’m gonna tell you right now she is a goddamn hero.
 You might’ve thought these things were happening before, but now you can see it all in front of you without a shadow of a doubt.
 That shit actually went down.
 She sucked that old guy’s dick.
 She really took one for the team on that one.
 That’s really gross.
 His dick is, like, 80 years old.
 It’s like tasting history.
 Like, five wars on it, the Civil Rights Movement, the Great Depression.
 This guy’s been fucking from 40 years before Bill Cosby‘s first rape.
 It’s a very old man.
 A very old penis.
But all that shit is still just name-calling.
 Like, name-calling does not break the modern black man.
 That’s not gonna do the trick.
 I don’t give a fuck about that.
 If I went to Kentucky Fried Chicken, and for some reason, everyone behind the counter had a Ku Klux Klan hood on top of their head, what do you think I’m gonna do in this day and age? Run out of Kentucky Fried Chicken? Not if I’m hungry.
 I’ll go straight to the front.
 “Hey, man.
 Let me get a two-piece.”
 I don’t give a fuck what he says.
 “You want a biscuit with that, nigger?”
 “I thought it came with a biscuit.
 What’s all this attitude? I want a two-piece.
 Chop, chop.
 You know what it is.”
 But I’m not gonna be mad.
 Why would I be mad? He’s the one that’s gotta work at Kentucky Fried Chicken, not me.
How about this? What if I lived in Austin and I had a white girlfriend? It’s possible in Austin.
 As a matter of fact, some people say it’s necessary.
 But that’s not the point.
 And me and my white girlfriend are at home one night, and we’re just doing what lovers do.
 Maybe she’s butt-naked and she’s down on one knee, giving me a hand-job.
 I love a good hand-job.
 And she’s really jerking me off.
 You know, getting her obliques nice and tight.
 I got a huge dick, so she’s like… 
[grunting]
 And I’m like, “Wow, this really feels wonderful.
 I think I’m gonna come.”
 And then she looks up at me and goes, “Come in my face… nigger.”
 I know, that’s a tough one.
 Well, what do you think I’m gonna do? “Hey!”
 That’s no time for integrity, ladies and gentlemen.
 I’m busting that nut in her face.
 I’ll sort through the ethics later.
 But I’m what they call a man of his word.
 If I say I’m coming, I’m coming.
 I don’t give a fuck what happens.
 God forbid, somebody could shoot me.
 If I say I’m coming, there’s still that— [imitates gunshot]
 It doesn’t mean I like getting shot.
Oh, boy.
 Yeah, a tough time for the blacks.
 I’m not gonna say nothing about the police.
 I’ll leave that for Chris Rock.
The other big sports story was, fucking, Ray Rice’s tape.
 Anyone see that Ray Rice tape? I can’t stop watching it.
 It’s fucking awful.
 It’s the most violent thing I’ve seen happen to a woman that was shot in color.
 Really fucking bad.
 If I could’ve froze time at that moment and gave Ray Rice some advice, I don’t think there’s any way possible I’d be like… “You should punch her in the face.”
 That’s a fucking terrible idea.
 At the same time, I also believe she shouldn’t have rushed him.
 What the fuck? You can’t beat him.
 Don’t rush a motherfucker that’s trained to stiff-arm people in the clutch.
 He’s gonna get the upper hand.
The only reason I bring him up is because he’s about to play football again.
 You didn’t know that? The NFL was told by a federal judge they had to reinstate Ray Rice because he was transparent with their investigation.
 He told them exactly what he did.
 And they can’t just change their ruling just because the tape came out.
 I get it.
 That’s like if I’m hanging out with my buddies, and I’m like, “Hey, guys, guess what I did last night? I fucked this big, fat girl I met at the club.”
 And they’re all like, “Oh, shit, Dave.
 That’s crazy.”
 And then they see a tape of me doing it, and they’re like… “We can’t hang out with you anymore, Dave.
 That’s not what this crew is all about.”
 I’d be like, “What? I told y’all what I did.”
What’s really fucked up is the tape was made before they were married.
 Isn’t that weird? I don’t know why she’d do that.
 I don’t even know why he would do that.
 As a guy, would you want to live with a woman that you had once punched in the face with all your strength? That’s some very bold Color Purple-type shit.
 “Celie! Come out here and shave me!”
 Are you out of your fucking mind?I had to ask an older friend of mine, just to get some perspective, this older black dude.
 Actually the fairest person I’ve ever met.
 And I asked him.
 I just said, “Hey, man, did you see that Ray Rice video?”
 And instantly, he was like, “David, that shit was disgusting.”
 And then a moment later, he goes… “I wonder what she said to him.”
 I don’t think that matters.
 I think the idea is you’re not supposed to punch her in the face.
 Because my wife says terrible shit to me.
 My wife once called me a pussy… in front of dinner guests.
 I know.
 I started to get mad, but then I was like, “Fuck it.
 She’s probably right.”
 I am a pussy.
 I admit it.
 I’m soft and warm and persuasive, like a real pussy.
 That’s right.
 Then I told her, “If you don’t take care of me properly, I might stink, like your pussy.”
[crowd]
 Ohh!Oh, we fight dirty at the Chappelle household.
 It’s not a big deal.
No, no.
 If you want to get to the bottom of a matter of the heart, what you’re supposed to do is ask a woman.
 Now, actually, there’s two women that I know— they’re both college professors in this little area I live in, and I meet them twice a week at Starbucks for coffee.
 We talk about important shit.
 And I asked the girls— we was in a coffee klatch.
 I said, “Yo, why do y’all think that this woman stayed with Ray Rice after he punched her in the face with all his strength?”
 And one of my girlfriends said, “David, you need to wake the fuck up.
 She’s staying for the money.”
 Now, wait a minute, ’cause my other girlfriend was like, “I disagree.
 I think that she actually loves him.”
 And I said, “Wait a minute, ladies.
 You know what? I think that you’re both right.”
 And what I was doing when I said that was preserving the possibility of a threesome with these bitches.
 I’d been chipping away at this pussy one cup of coffee at a time for, like, four years.
 I wasn’t gonna throw that hard work away with some Ray Rice shit.
 I don’t care that much.
 I’m just being real.
It’s fucked up, man.
 It’s a tough time for the blacks.
[man]
 I love you, Dave!I love you, too.
 And then here comes the banana peel.
 I’m waiting on it any second.
 You know that’s how it starts.
 I saw in the paper today that the guy that threw the banana at me got arrested again ’cause he threw a banana at another motherfucker in a bar in Santa Fe.
 Look it up online after the show.
 He actually did that.
 And that guy was black, too.
 I’m just saying.
 And you know why the guy said he did it that night? He said, “I did it ’cause Dave Chappelle is racist.”
 So, nigga? That’s not the best way to handle that if I am racist.
 What if Martin Luther King just went around throwing tuna casserole on white people? Would that work?[woman shouting]
Huh?   Come on, Dave!Your girl’s bubbling.
 She’s drunk as hell, buddy.
 Listen, sir, I don’t know what she’s saying, but just take my advice.
 Get some water in her, or you’re gonna have some dry pussy when you get home.
 His dick’s gonna be chafed the fuck up tomorrow.
Santa Maria.
 Who got a cigarette in here? Anyone got a cigarette I can borrow? Yeah.
 You, fella.
 Yeah, please.
[crowd]
 Ohh!Let me see.
 This is a Marlboro menthol.
 This could’ve been anybody.
 If it was a Newport, I’d be like, “A black dude threw that up.”
 But a Marlboro menthol, that’s one of them riddles.

Is the word “pussy” offensive?[crowd]
 No!All right, just checking, just checking.
 I asked that crowd when we was in Denver, “Is the word ‘pussy’ offensive?”
 And the whole crowd said no, except for two people.
 One was a woman in the front, older than me, maybe around my age.
 Definitely a feminist.
 You know what I mean.
 Short haircut, plaid shirt.
 You know what I’m saying.
 And she didn’t say it offended her.
 What she said is, she said, “I am uncomfortable with that word.”
 And I was like, “Really? You?”
 And before I could ask her why, there was one guy in the balcony— I don’t think he was saying this to me, but he said this.
 Everybody heard him say it.
 He goes, “It’s delicious.”
 I was like, “What?”
 I don’t think I’ve ever heard pussy called delicious before in my life.
 Now, this is not to say that it’s bad.
 But it’s definitely an acquired taste.
 I don’t think any of us tasted pussy our first time like… 
[smacking lips]
 “Mmm! It’s good!”
 It needs something.
You know, it’s illegal for a gynecologist to say the word “pussy.”
 They can only say “vagina,” or they can name individual parts medically, but they can never say shorthand, even if the gynecologist is a woman.
 I feel like if it was a woman gynecologist, it’s cool.
 Like, “Am I all right?”
 She’s like, “Girl, that pussy is…” [clicks tongue]
 She’d be like, “Yeah.”
I don’t think men should be allowed to be gynecologists.
 That shit is a conflict of interest.
----Punchline----
 Even when my wife was pregnant, we used to go to a gynecologist…

 and he’d put her legs up in that stirrup like this.
 He’d be like, “All right, Mrs.
 Chappelle, just try to relax.”
 I’d push him.
 “Back up, motherfucker! I got this.
 Just tell me what to look for.”
 One of those homestyle checkups.
There’s too many ethical questions when men do that.
 Like, can a gynecologist lose their license… for smelling their fingers during an exam? Is that illegal? How could they not? These are men.
 It’s like if you have a good barbeque, you don’t even think about it.
 You just…The word “pussy” is only offensive if you’re older.
 People my age and younger, I don’t think we even— We dance to that shit.
 That song comes on the radio— ♪ I beat the pussy up ♪ That’s on the radio.
 ♪ I beat the pussy up ♪ That’s a pretty harsh song.
 It’s nothing like a love song.
 There’s no tracks of his tears, no midnight trains to Georgia.
 This man simply beats the pussy up.
 Unbelievable.
 You don’t even know if he’s having sex with these women.
 They might just pull their pants down.
 He’d be like, pow! “G-Unit!”
You’ll be watching HBO.
 “Hi, I’m Larry Merchant, standing here ringside with the pussy after a devastating bout with 50 Cent.
 Pussy, come over here and let me talk to you for a second.
 My God, you look terrible.
 Your lips seem to be swollen.
 You’re bleeding a little bit.
 Tell me, pussy, what happened inside of that ring with 50?”
 [panting]
 “I don’t know, Larry.
 I felt really good in the first round.
 I was ready to fight.
 I was warm and moist, and… I don’t know.
 He just hit me from angles I wasn’t expecting.
 Front, left.
 The backside surprised me the most.”
 “Well, pussy, let’s take a look at round four.
 This is where it all went wrong for you.
 Here you come out of your corner, pussy.
 You’re fighting really good.
 It looks like you got 50 with a right and a left, but then 50 slips you a jab.
 And there.
 There.
 Right there.
 You see that? He punches you right on that— that little bean thing you have on the top of your head.
 I don’t know what that is.
 There’s 50 just pounding away at that bean, over and over.
 Now, pussy, tell me, what goes through a fighter’s mind when their bean gets rattled around like that?”
 “I don’t think I was thinking anything, Larry.
 I’m a real good defensive fighter.
 It’s real hard to get to me.
 I’ve never been punched directly on my bean before.
 As a matter of fact, most fighters don’t even know that bean exists.
 I guess he just hit me, then I lost control of my legs.
 I don’t know what else to tell you.”
I like when Lil Wayne talks about pussy, because he’s— Remember Lil Wayne used to have that song? He say, “♪ I got a bitch that plays movies In my Jacuzzi” ♪ Then he goes like this: “♪ Pussy juicy ♪
” That shit— That shit always makes me laugh.
 No guy says that.
 Only Lil Wayne says some shit like that.
 If you was fucking a girl, and she’s like, “Is this pussy good?”
 And you’re like, “Yeah, it’s juicy.
 It’s good.”
 The pussy was juicy.
 That’s why I’m not Lil Wayne.
 ‘Cause if I was in a hot tub with a girl, and I could tell that the pussy was juicy while I was in the hot tub, I’d probably get out of the tub.
 I’m a germophobe.
 I just picture Lil Wayne like… “What is this strange oil… floating in my hot tub water? It’s pussy juice.”
That shit was so funny to me, I must’ve wrote, like, no less than 40 jokes with the punch line “pussy juice,” and all of them worked to some degree 100% of the time.
 I’ll do one more just so you believe me.
 Okay.
 All right.
 In this next piece, it’s a special episode of CSI.
 For some reason, Lil Wayne’s guest starring as the lead detective.
 Okay? That’s the setup.
 Are you ready? Here it goes.
 “Has anyone else been on this crime scene?”
 “No.”
 “It’s very strange.
 This place is virtually undisturbed.
 No forced entry.
 No sign of a struggle.
 Shine your flashlight right here.
 I just slipped in something.
 What is this? What is this? It glistens in the light.
 Smooth to the touch.
 This is pussy juice.
 She must’ve been sitting Indian style.”
 Thirty-nine more where that came from.
Everybody’s mad about something.
 Recently, I got attacked online by some gay bloggers, and it hurt my feelings.
 I have no problem with gay people, but I fucking hate bloggers.
 I’m not saying it ’cause this person was gay.
 They was just acting like a bitch online.
 They was mischaracterizing my jokes, trying to make a point off of me, when it was really like— “Yo, I’m your ally, motherfucker.
 I’m not trying to stop gay people.
 I got better shit to do.”
 This motherfucker was saying things, trying to get gay people to beat me up.
 Seriously, he was like… 
[effeminate voice]
 “Dave Chappelle’s jokes—” I don’t know how he actually talks.
 I’m just making his voice up.
 “Dave Chappelle’s jokes were an affront to the manhood of all gay men.”
 What the fuck does that mean? I didn’t say anything that would allude to gay men not being men.
 I know you’re men.
 In fact, what could be manlier than fucking another guy in the ass? It’s the most gangster shit I’ve ever heard of in my life.
 I told you, I’m not cut out for that.
 I’m a pussy.
You know what I said? This is all I said.
 First of all, I’ll tell you right now what I said, and I’ll tell you this was not a joke.
 It’s a true story, and I just happened to tell it.
 What happened was, I went to a gallery party, all right? I don’t know who in here has ever been rich before, but these are very nice parties.
 You know, wine and cheese and baller conversation.
 And there was a few eccentric types, one of which was a very wealthy man that happened to be wearing a dress.
 I don’t know what you call him.
 A tranny, or a drag queen, perhaps.
 Whatever he was, he was definitely a man.
 And this man was definitely on drugs.
 I don’t know what kind of drugs he was on, but I knew he had too much.
 He didn’t look good.
 He was like this.
 [moans]
 He looked sick, and all his friends were standing around him, concerned, trying to revive him.
 I don’t know what, it looked like some kind of gay CPR.
 There was fanning and shit.
 They was like— I saw all this from a distance.
 Now, I should’ve minded my own business, but I got curious.
 I was like… And I went over there.
 All I said, “Excuse me, gentlemen.
 Is he okay?”
 Then they looked at me like I was evil.
 “She is fine.”
 I said, “Word? Oh.
 I’m sorry.
 I didn’t know this is what we were doing.”
 Here’s my thing.
 I support anybody’s right to be whoever they feel like they are inside.
 I’m your ally in that.
 However… my question is… to what degree do I have to participate in your self-image? Is it fair that I have to change my whole pronoun game up for this motherfucker? That doesn’t make sense.
 Seriously.
 If I put on an argyle sweater, and I’m like, “Hey, everybody, I feel like a white guy in this sweater, and I want some goddamn respect and a bank loan,” that’s not gonna work.
 You don’t give a fuck how I feel.
 Why should I give a fuck how you feel? “Nigger” is a pronoun.
But there was no time for philosophical debate.
 This was an emergency situation.
 I said, “Fine.
 I’m sorry, guys.
 I was just worried because— because she looks terrible.
 And she just fell off the bench.
 It appears that her dick is popping out of her dress.
 You mind if I call an ambulance, champ? I’d rather not be at a party where a tranny OD’s.
 There’s too many questions to answer.”
Okay, I’ve been through this before.
 I had a friend from high school.
 Now, in high school, this guy was a thug.
 He was a fucking dope boy.
 He did it all.
 He was a wild dude.
 People used to be very scared of him.
 And then after high school, word on the street was he had come out the closet.
 I personally didn’t believe it.
 I bring him up because last year, he calls me out of the blue, like, “Yo, what’s up, man? I got your number from so-and-so.
 I heard you’re gonna be in New York doing a show.
 Could I get some tickets?”
 I was like, “Fuck yeah, you can get some tickets.
 How you been?”
 He said, “We’ll catch up at the show, but I appreciate it.
 I’ll see you soon.”
 I said, “All right, man.
 Take care.”
 I was about to hang up, but I couldn’t resist.
 I was just like, “Hey, nigga, I heard you was gay.
 What’s going on with that?”
 And I wish I didn’t ask.
 ‘Cause he sounded like he was dying to talk about that shit, and he had a long story about it.
 It’s not that I didn’t care, but I was— I don’t like talking on the phone.
 I was watching TV at the same time.
 So, I just wasn’t really paying attention like I should.
 I was trying to sound supportive, but I didn’t really know what to say.
 So, I just mumbled and shit throughout this conversation.
 I was like, “Well, you know, nigga, you’re gay, man.
 You’re just gay.
 Come on, man.”
 This went on for a while.
 Then finally, I had to say something definitive to get him off the phone.
 And I was like, “Hey, you know what? Don’t let people get you down, all right? And the next time someone tries to make you feel bad about yourself, just remember: Everybody fucks funny to somebody.”
 He didn’t like that shit.
 He said, “What the fuck does that mean?”
 I said, “Huh?”
 He said, “You saying I fuck funny, motherfucker?”
 I said, “No, that’s not what I’m saying.
 I’m saying everybody’s different.”
 He said, “You didn’t say ‘different.
’ You said ‘funny.
’ What’s so fucking funny about the way I fuck?”
 And I said, “Hey, man, I fuck feet.”
 He said, “What?!”
Oh, this is not a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
 I get women to squeeze their feet together like this, and I fuck them right in that little space in their feet.
 But you can’t build a community behind that shit.
 There’s no flag for us.
That shit made him laugh.
 The next day, after the show, I saw him backstage.
 He was like, “What’s up, man? I’m like, “Oh, shit! What’s going on?”
 He had his buddy with him.
 He goes, “Dave, I want you to meet Manuel.
 Manuel’s my fiancé.
 We’re in New York getting married ’cause it’s legal here.”
 I said, “Oh.
 Well, congratulations, fellas.”
 And Manuel was like, “Gracias.”
 And he went to go get some drinks, and then my buddy looked at me.
 He was like, “So, Dave… what do you think?”
 And I started mumbling again.
 “Well, you’re gay, nigga.
 You know, you’re just gay.”
 He said, “I’m a little nervous about getting married, man.
 It’s a big step.”
 I said, “Yeah, it is.
 It’s a big step.”
 He said, “You’ve been married for a while.
 You got any advice for us?”
 “No, I’m married to a woman.
 Sorry about that.”
 And he corrected me.
 He said, “No.
 You married the person that you love, so it’s essentially the same.”
 I said, “You know, man, the problem with that statement is that it makes the assumption that I love her.

 As a matter of fact, she eats and spends this shit.
 No, I told him, I said, “You know what you should do, man? First of all, you shouldn’t do it.”
 I’m talking about being legally married.
 It’s not that you’re gay as much as just legal marriage is a fucking diabolical leverage game in the United States.
 I’m just being honest.
 Devoid of religious significance or the idea of love, marriage is nothing but an awful contract that you shouldn’t sign.
 I’m just being real.
 Because you start out loving each other.
 Then two years later, you’re just building a case against one another… for a hypothetical court date that may or may not ever happen.
 You throw being gay on top of that, that shit is explosive.
It’s that Ray Rice shit.
 Right after Ray Rice went through all that shit, I was at a party and I met this kid Michael Sam.
 You know Michael Sam? Very nice guy.
 He’s the first openly gay NFL player.
 And Michael’s a very nice guy, a very brave guy, but when I met him, I couldn’t help but think, “What’s gonna happen when Michael Sam beats his wife up in the elevator? Is that domestic violence, or is that just two niggas working shit out in an elevator?”
 You know what I mean?Anyway… I give all married men the same advice, gay or straight.
 Get a dog.
 Because a dog will love you all the time, but she’s not going to.
 It was real talk.
 I didn’t even know about dogs, and my kids got the dog.
 They brought him home from the shelter.
 I didn’t even want him.
 They were like, “Can we keep him?”
 I said, “Nope.”
 I said, “Where did you get this dog?”
 They’re like, “From the shelter.”
 I was like, “Ugh.
 Probably something wrong with him.
 Can’t keep him.”
 And then my kids started crying and screaming like the dog had gambling debts.
 “Please, Dad! If you don’t let us keep him, they’re gonna kill him!”
 I was like, “Oh— All right, you can keep him.”
   And this dog was a menace.
 I hated his guts.
 One night, I’d smoked a bunch of weed, and I was eating a sandwich, and Baba came over— Baba is the dog.
 He came over and was staring at me.
 This will make you very uncomfortable, if he’s just looking at you eating.
 I had to give him a piece of my sandwich so he’d go away, and that’s how we became friends.
 Now, if you see me walking down the street with Baba, I ain’t got no leash or nothing.
 He walks right next to me.
 If I stop, he’ll stop.
 And if I go, he’ll go.
 And all my friends are like, “Yo, Dave, that shit is dope.
 How’d you train Baba to do that shit?”
 “I’ve never trained Baba.
 I’m just a messy eater.”
 If I drop food and Baba’s not around, all I gotta do is call him.
 “Baba!”
 He’s a black dude’s dog, so he doesn’t come right away.
 He peeks first to see what’s going on.
 I gotta tap my foot so he can see the food.
 “Over here, little buddy.”
 He’s like, “Thanks, Dave,” and he’ll come get it and run off.
 But he knows all my habits.
 If he smells weed in the house, he’ll be like… 
[sniffing]
 “Oh, this motherfucker’s about to eat.”
 And he’ll just come running.
Baba got me through a very difficult time in my marriage.
 We spend the most time together.
 It’s not that me and my wife don’t spend time together, but we’ve been married so long, we don’t talk like— I don’t know if anyone’s married here, but after ten years, all that chatty shit goes away.
 You’ve said it all.
 You know what I mean.
 Yeah.
 We’re just in the zone.
 She says the same shit to me every night before she goes to bed.
 I’ll be the last one up.
 She’s like, “I’m gonna get some sleep, Dave.
 Good night.”
 “All right, babe.
 I’m gonna stay up and watch television.
 Good night.”
 Then she’ll walk halfway up the steps.
 “David?”
 “Hmm?”
 “Don’t eat the kids’ lunch.”
 And then she walks away.
 Well, the crazy shit is, I don’t even eat their lunch anymore.
 Back in the day, I used to eat that shit.
 You know how that goes.
 Now I might smoke some weed in the middle of the night, and she’ll leave neatly-wrapped sandwiches all over the kitchen.
 I’m gonna eat it.
 What’s the big deal? Why can’t she just make another one in the morning? I mean, I got sons anyway.
 And sons love everything their dads do.
 My kids will be at school the next day like, “Oh, Dad bit my sandwich.
 Oh, shit!”
 Their dad is Dave Chappelle, man.
 You could trade that sandwich for something better.
 What I’m doing is adding value to their lunch.
 But she doesn’t understand these types of things.
Anyway, she gets mad at me.
 She’s mad at me now ’cause I got myself in trouble.
 I got myself extorted, which happens in this business.
 I come home from the road.
 There was a FedEx sitting on the kitchen table, and it was addressed to me, so I opened it.
 I don’t know who delivered it.
 And there was a videocassette inside with a note written on it that said, “Gotcha.”
 Oh, my God.
 Can you imagine? I freaked out.
 I tore the whole house apart, trying to find a VCR.
 I hadn’t seen a tape in over a decade.
 And I watched the tape, and it was awful.
 They got me.
 It was a tape of me— I was fucking a girl, okay? But it was from before I was married.
 But it was not a good look.
 And I felt sick to my stomach, and I looked up at the clock, and then I saw my wife was coming home in ten minutes, and I just panicked.
 I jerked off to the tape real fast, and then— and then I called the FBI.
 Who, by the way, made me feel much better.
 They didn’t say they were gonna catch ’em for sure, but they had the demeanor of some confident people that would catch ’em.
 So, I didn’t worry about it too much.
 And then, not even a week later, five days later, I come home, and there’s another videocassette sitting on my porch.
 As soon as I saw it, I just called the police.
 “They’ve done it again.
 You should probably look for a guy with bell-bottoms on, because I don’t know who the fuck is sending tapes!”
 And that second tape was the worst shit I’d ever seen in my life.
 It was awful.
 Career-ending bad.
 It was a tape of me… jerking off to the tape a week earlier.
 I don’t even know how they’d even get such a thing.
 I had to explain all of this to my wife.
 She was very mad.
No thing in this world is as cold as a woman’s cold shoulder, ’cause she was mad, but she wouldn’t talk to me about it.
 She would just punish me in little ways, make me do shit that I hate to do.
 Like pick the kids up from school.
 That’s one thing she made me do.
 That’s a hardship for me.
 I got one son that goes to a public school.
 And… his little brother goes to a private school.
 It’s an experiment.
 I just want to see what’s gonna happen to them.
 But what’s weird is, my little son in private school, he’s, like, my thuggy son, you know what I mean? I don’t know where he gets that from.
 He’s not getting it from me.
 And he’s definitely not getting it from that school.
 That school is very— It’s a liberal school.
 It’s the kind of school— there might be, like, 12 black students in the entire school, and I’m the only black parent.
 And none of the parents like me, either.
 Not ’cause I’m black, but they don’t like how I roll.
 I’ll be showing up late all the time, and I’m, like, in a Porsche, and I’m blasting music that they don’t like.
 ♪ I beat the pussy up ♪ Then I pull into the parking lot.
 I might be smoking a cigarette with the kids in the car.
 Then I pull into that handicapped space.
 And when I get out of the handicapped space, they always want to say some passive-aggressive shit.
 “Morning, Dave.
 Don’t know if you noticed, but you actually parked in the handicapped space.”
 “Yeah, you know, Frank, I did notice.
 But who is this handicapped guy we’re all waiting on that never shows up?”
So, I hate going over to that school.
 The only parents that are nice to me is a lesbian couple— Kate and Sarah.
 Actually, Kate hates my guts.
 Sarah knows that I’m black, and she’s half-black, so she just understands me.
 You know what I’m saying? I can’t explain it.
 Because I’ll say shit, and Kate’s just too serious about being a lesbian.
 I’ll be like, “Hey, Kate.
 Hey, Sarah.
 You guys going to the father-son picnic next week? How’s that gonna work?”
 And Kate will instantly be furious.
 But Sarah knows I’m fucking around, so she’ll just say something cool.
 “I don’t know, Dave.
 Maybe me and Kate will flip for that shit.”
 I said, “Bitch, you better save that coin toss, because everybody knows you’re strapping on in that household.”
 And then Kate will turn bright red, but Sarah just fist-bumps me, like, “You’re right, nigga.
 It’s me.
 Bop.”
We’re good friends.
 We’re good friends.
 They invite me to stuff.
 They’re my only friends at the school.
 So, imagine my surprise when I go to pick my son up after all this happens.
 And the teacher is waiting outside for me.
 She’s just standing right there in the middle of the handicapped space.
 I knew something was wrong, so I rolled the window down.
 “What’s going on?”
 “Hi, David.
 Can we talk to you for a minute in the office?”
 I said, “No, fuck that.
 We gotta talk right here.
 What’s going on?”
 I knew it was bad.
 “Ibrahim had a fight.”
 I said, “A fight?”
 “Don’t worry.
 Everyone’s okay.”
 I said, “Everyone? What happened?”
 “Well, that’s it.
 We don’t know what happened because he won’t talk to anybody.
 All we know is that he punched Sarah Jr.
 in the face.”
 I said, “Oh, no!”
 Sarah’s one of the only parents I’m not sure I can beat up in this school.
 Just then, Kate and Sarah pulled up to pick up their daughter, and then we all had to go into the office, and I was really worried ’cause I didn’t want them to kick me out of the school.
 And then they brought my son in.
 He was crying.
 They brought him in like a prisoner.
 He was like, “Ohh! Oh!”
 I said, “Son, stop crying, calm down.
 Do not look at these mean faces.
 I need you to look at my face, and I need you to tell me the truth, buddy, all right? Just tell me the truth.
 Is it true? Did you punch that girl Sarah Jr.
 in the face?”
 I was trying to give him a signal to lie, but he didn’t pick up on it.
 I was like… He wasn’t paying attention.
 He’s like, “Yes, Daddy, I punched her face.”
 “Oh, my God.
 Why? Why would you do that? You’re not supposed to put your hands on anybody.”
 And his answer was so gangster, it scared all the parents in the room.
 He was like… 
[whimpering]
 “‘Cause she had it coming.”
 I said… And everyone looked at me.
 I said, “I did not teach him.
 I don’t know where he got that from.”
 I said, “What does that mean, son? That is crazy talk! What does that mean?”
 And then he just started crying like he was Tupac.
 [crying]
 “These kids keep fucking with me!”
 I told his teacher, I said, “Well, now, wait a minute.
 This kid is a lot of things, but he’s not a liar.
 And if he said they was fucking with him, they did something to him.
 Son, what’s going on? What did they do to you?”
 “Dad, I’m tired of this shit.
 It’s been going on all week.”
 I said, “What’s going on all week?”
 He said, “We was at lunch, and that bitch bit my sandwich.”
 I said, “Oh.”
 He said, “It’s the fourth time this week.
 I’m tired of this sandwich-biting bitch.”
 I said, “Stop using that word.
 Let’s go home.”
That’s a quiet car ride home.
 We got to the house, he just ran right up to his room, slammed the door.
 His mother came downstairs.
 By then, she’d heard about everything.
 She was looking at me, like, “Oh, my God.”
 I said, “I know.
 It’s fucked up.”
 She said, “You bit that goddamn sandwich, didn’t you, Dave?”
 I said, “I’m tired of you accusing me of shit!”
 And I just ran out of the house.
 Jumped in my car and drove off.
 Of course I bit that sandwich.
 But I knew that she was just really mad about that tape, so now she was gonna punish me about a fucking sandwich that I’d bit.
 I was mad as fuck.
 You know what I said to myself? I said, “I should just never go home.
 Fuck this shit.”
 By the way, that’s how people used to get divorced in the ’40s.
 There wasn’t no divorce court in America.
 Back in those days, if you wanted to get out your marriage, you’d just tell your wife, “Hey, baby, I’m gonna get a pack of cigarettes.
 I’ll be right back.”
 You would just leave with the clothes on your back.
 That’s when men were men.
 And there was no Internet back then, so you could move 11 miles away and have a whole new life.
But I ended up going back home… late at night, and came in the room, and she was actually changing for bed.
 You can always tell your wife is mad at you when they cover their titties up when you walk in.
 “Oh!”
 “Let those titties out.
 It’s me, baby.
 Can we just talk about this for a minute?”
 She said, “David, there’s nothing to talk about.
 I already know you bit the sandwich.
 And don’t go looking for their lunch.
 I hid it.”
 I said, “I don’t want to talk about the sandwich.
 I want to talk about it.
 The tape.
 I know that’s why you’re mad.”
 It was a very difficult conversation.
 I had to crack a few jokes.
 And she laughed a little, and it helped her relax, and we started talking, and then she cracked a few jokes… that hurt my feelings, honestly.
 But— But we talked.
 And you know what she told me? She told me that she was madder about the second extortion tape than she was about the first one.
 Which doesn’t make sense at all.
 What’s wrong with a guy touching his own private parts? It’s my own business.
 It’s not like I do it all the time.
 As a matter of fact, sometimes I do it for her benefit.
 A lot of guys do this.
 It’s called the mercy jerk.
 That’s the one that happens in the middle of the night when you’re about to roll on top of her and you see her face, and you’re like, “She looks tired.”
 That takes a lot of love and discipline to back out of a room with a rock-hard ick.
 Sometimes I don’t make it.
 “Uh-oh.
 Uh-oh.
 Someone fell asleep with their socks off, didn’t they?”
 You can’t rape feet.
 You can’t rape feet.
The only time I jerk off now is if I know how long she’ll be gone.
 That’s the only way I can get my head in the game.
 Sometimes she’ll tell me, “Dave, I’m gonna take the kids to my mom’s real quick.
 I’ll probably be back in a couple of hours.”
 “A couple hours?”
 You can get a good one in in two hours.
 That’s the kind of session where you’ll take all your clothes off.
 I’ll be butt-naked in the living room like, “Get these fucking toys out of my way!”
 Disgusting.
 Foot on the coffee table, just stroking it out, taking my time.
 And I got a bowl of cereal waiting for me right here.
 That’s when you have that privacy.
 You can have a loud orgasm.
 I miss those.
 [screaming]
 You know, when a guy busts a nut, right after that, there’s a window of six minutes where he does the most rational thinking he ever does.
 That’s when he’s always horrified.
 [grunting and panting]
 “My God, what have I done? Oh, my God, it’s everywhere.
 [screaming]
