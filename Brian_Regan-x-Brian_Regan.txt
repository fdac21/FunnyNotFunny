Tennis is weird.
 The scoring system per game in tennis is mathematically ludicrous.
 It doesn’t make even a little bit of sense.
 First of all, there’s no zero.
 If you don’t have any points, you have to say “love.”
 If you don’t say it like that, your opponent gets upset.
 -“How many points you have, Brian?”
 -“Um, I think you know.
 I’ve never touched the ball ever.
 I have zero.”
 “You have love.”

That’s the smart part of the scoring system.
 If you get your first shot in, he’ll go, “You got 15.”
 “No, that’s not possible.
 We just arrived.”
 You get the next shot in, you get another 15, to a total of 30.
 “Oh, okay.
 I got it.
 Say no more.”
 But you get the next shot in, you get ten points… to a total of 40.
 No explanation as to why this ratio… is any different from the first two volleys.
 Ten, so say the random gods.

 I award ten at this juncture for no apparent reason.

Another thing I don’t like about tennis.
 Why are you allowed two tries for every single serve? You get a mulligan every serve? “Give me the ball back, I hit it into the net.
 Give me the ball.”
 “I get a point?”
 “No, we’re playing the most lenient game in the history of sports.
 I can make error after error after error after error and still be in this game.
 Give me the ball.
 Give me the ball.”
 The hell? Can you imagine seeing that in other sports? A quarterback looking at a defensive back with a football? “Give me the ball back.
 Where do you think you’re going with that? Bring me the ball back.
 I did not wanna throw that interception.
 [yelling]
 Give me the ball back.
 Give me the ball back.”
 So, why in tennis do they allow that? That encourages people who play three times in their whole life.
 They know every first shot is a freebie, so they try to land some rocket… that don’t have a chance in hell of ever touching down on the planet Earth.
 [mimics ball bouncing]

 They should whip out an iPad.
 “In fact, this is me from an interview just last evening.”
 “Tomorrow, it’s gonna be important for us to get into field position.
 The defensive back on me is one of the best players in the league.
 It’ll be challenging for me to get open.
 In the last two minutes, I’ll make a nice head fake, get open in the end zone.

 She gives him the phone.
 He has no idea there’s a camera in there.
 He’s whipping it all over the place.
 I’m seeing his face zip by at the speed of light.
 I’m yelling, “Stop moving the phone! Aim it in one place!”
 He thinks it’s for audio reasons.
 He aims it at the corner of his room, I’m seeing a cobweb dangling.
 “Can you hear me?”
 “I always could hear you.
 Aim it at your face, Dad.”
 So, he sort of gets it but not really.
 It’s like two unfocused eyes.
 They don’t know where to look.

 I drove my dad to the restaurant where we were meeting.
 He and I get out of the car.
 We’re walking in.
 He’s an old guy, doesn’t walk well.
 He’s shuffling along.
 I said, “Dad, you need help?”
 He goes, “I got it.”
 I said, “I’m next to you if you need me.”
